Neoclassical economics: a particular approach to economics with a particular set of assumptions about market participants and associated mathematical models. 

Neoclassical economics divides the market into firms, labour, consumers. 
Everyone pursues self-interest. Firms are profit maximimizing, consumers are utility maximizing, and labours are paid their wage based on their productivity. 

"According to this line of thought, the value of a good or service is determined through a hypothetical maximization of utility by income-constrained individuals and of profits by firms facing production costs and employing available information and factors of production, in accordance with rational choice theory"

Under the two fundamental theorems of welfare economics, a free market leads to a Pareto-efficient allocation of goods and services.

When the allocation is not efficient, we call it market failure. 

Market failure happens when one of the conditions required for the fundamental theorem (about nature of the market, nature of the goods, or nature of the exchange) to apply fails:

- Presence of Public goods and externalities
- Information Assymtery (leads to the phenonmenon of adverse selection and moral hazard)
- Non-competitive markets: When one of the participants has enough market power to influence prices (mkonopolities, oligopoly, monopsonies etc.) 
- Time-inconsistent preferences
- Principal Agent Problem

Market failures provide a reason for intervention in the markets by institutions (Supra-national, self regulating, or governments)



Government failure occurs when government intervention leads to ineffcient allocation of resouces:

- Taxes and subsidies
- Wage and price controls
- Regulations

A key assumption of neoclassical economics is that economic participants act on perfect information. Information assymetry deals with transactions where one party has more or better information than the other, about factors relevant to the transaction: product quality, prices and other factors.

Two types: 
Hidden characteristics or hidden actions. Examples: Insurance, User cars, Risk taking behavior post insurance. Restaurant offering "all you can eat" at a fixed price 



- Insurance, if one charges fair rate, which is beneficial to unhealthy people, and harmful fo rhealty people
- Used Cars
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil

Problems: 

Adverse Selection: Desirable trasnactions and their associated surprlus is lost. Buyers may not make choices to avoid being exploited, and sells might have to sell their good quality products at lower prices than they deserve. 


Equity implications: Consequently, asymmetric information does not cause an efficiency problem, but it does have equity implications. Sellers of lemons benefit and sellers of good cars suffer from consumersâ€™ inability to distinguish quality.

Driving out the good: Consumers who buy the good cars get a bargain,
and buyers of lemons are left with a sour taste in
their mouths.
Unravelling: "adverse selection is a market situation where buyers and sellers have different information, so that a participant might participate selectively in trades which benefit them the most, at the expense of the other party. The party without the information is worried about an unfair ("rigged") trade, which occurs when the party who has all the information uses it to their advantage. The fear of rigged trade can prompt the worried party to withdraw from the interaction, diminishing the volume of trade in the market. This can cause a knock-on effect and through a positive feedback loop, will lead to the unraveling of the market."

Model:

Now suppose that the sellers of good cars
place a value of v = $7,000 on their cars
and thus are unwilling to sell them for
$6,000.

As a result, the lemons drive good cars out of the
market.

Buyers realize that, at any price less than
$7,000, they can buy only lemons.

Consequently, in equilibrium, the 1,000 lemons
sell for the expected (and actual) price of
$4,000, and no good cars change hands.


-------


This unwillingness to produce high-quality
products is due to an externality: A firm
does not completely capture the benefits
from raising the quality of its product.

The social value of raising the quality, as
reflected by the increased revenues shared
by all firms, is greater than the private
value, which is only the higher revenue
received by the firm with the good product.


Because adverse selection results from one
party exploiting asymmetric information
about a hidden characteristic, the two main
methods for solving adverse selection
problems are to:

-----


* Restrict the ability of the informed party to
take advantage of hidden information.

Example:  Universal Coverage

Health insurance markets have adverse selection because low-risk consumers do not buy insurance at prices that reflect the average risk. Such adverse selection can be eliminated by providing insurance to everyone or by mandating that everyone buy insurance.

Lemon Laws:
Lemon laws act as a form of consumer protection in the event the buyer purchase a defective product. While usually applied to automobiles, lemon laws are also used for most consumer goods. Such regulations were enacted to reduce cases where manufacturers knowingly sold defective products. Lemon laws vary by countries, but generally require the seller to repurchase the product or replace it. For example, the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices allows for consumers to sue for triple damages in the event of sustaining harm as a result of purchasing a defective product as a result of the seller withholding information at the time of the transaction. As such, such government regulations act as a deterrent against sellers exploiting the asymmetric information between the parties involved. This, in turn, reduces the problem of adverse selection, as buyers who are knowingly protected by lemon laws are more inclined to engage in transactions they previously would not have done so due to the lack of viable information available to them.

Warranty: 
By offering a warranty for the product the seller intends to sell, they are able to indirectly communicate private information about the product to the buyer. Warranties assist in conveying information about the seller's confidence in the product for its quality, by acting as a guarantee on the product.[27] A common example is in the used car market, where apart from warranties offered by the seller itself, the buyer may purchase additional warranties in the form of insurance from third-party companies.

* Equalize information among the parties.
    * Screening - an action taken by an uninformed person to determine the information possessed by informed people.
        * Second degree price discrimination is an example of screening whereby a seller offers a menu of options and the buyer's choice reveals his private information. For example, a business traveler that refuses a weekend stay over reveals to the airline that he is in fact a business traveler and therefore has a higher willingness to pay than a leisure traveler. As another example, a consumer with a high willingness to pay for quality may choose to purchase a more expensive computer with more hard drive space over a cheaper version with less hard drive space.
        * An employer seeking a salesperson may offer a contract with a low base salary supplemented with a commission when sales are made. A potential employee who privately knows he is bad at sales will self-select away from this firm while a potential employee who privately knows he is good at sales would accept such a contract.
    * Signaling - an action taken by an informed person to send information to an uninformed person.

* Third-Party Information
    * Standard - a metric or scale for evaluating the quality of a particular product.
    * Certification - a report that a particular product meets or exceeds a given standard.

Reputation Systems:
In markets where the seller has private information about the product they wish to sell, reputation mechanisms help to reduce adverse selection by acting as a signal of quality. An example would be the online marketplace, Ebay. A seller known for selling high-quality goods can further enhance its reputation by utilising Ebay's reputation system. There is an incentive for the seller to do so, as buyers who derive utility from purchasing the product are naturally inclined to source their purchase from high-quality sellers. As such, buyers are able to rely on the reputation system as a signal to filter high-quality sellers from low-quality sellers.

Moral Hazard

Moral hazard occurs when an entity has an incentive to increase its exposure to risk because it does not bear the full costs of that risk. For example, when a corporation is insured, it may take on higher risk knowing that its insurance will pay the associated costs. A moral hazard may occur where the actions of the risk-taking party change to the detriment of the cost-bearing party after a financial transaction has taken place.

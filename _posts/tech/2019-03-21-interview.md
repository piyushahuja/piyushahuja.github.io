If you cannot persuade a person to hire you for the skills you are good at,  how do you even expect to win friends and influence people in any other enterprises of life?  How are you going to persuade investors to back your vision with their capital? How are you going to woo a person you want to spend the of your life with? How would you befriend a person you respect and admire? How would you command the loyalty of your tribe?

It's all about empathy: 

Interviewers go through hundreds of resumes just like you, and have probably interviewed 10-12 people just like you in the current phase. You have to stand out and make it as easy as possible for them to say "Yes, this is what I want". Someone that eases their worries and makes them look good for be able to hire you. You have to project "I am your guy". You have to make them feel good about hiring you.

## Before the interview 

**Prepare stories which highlight skills that the interviewer is looking for**


At the interview, understand why the interviewer is asking the question and tell them what they want to hear.
Interviewers have a purpose for every question. Technical interviewers are trying to get you to demonstrate a range of skills.  They've asked this question a 1000 times and are well versed in the possible answer. Behavioral questions (“Tell me about a time…”) are looking for a soft skill. If you think about the question briefly, you can guess what specifically they're seeking. Often it's directly stated in the wording of the question!

Stuff People Look For:

- **Getting things done**:  This is the most basic requirement, but it's astounding how many people can't get stuff done well, reliably, and on time. 
    - Can you do what the job requires day-to-day? Can you learn rapidly on the job and adapt as needs change? Can you get yourself unstuck and ask for help from the right people? Can you really deliver when it counts most? And can you keep getting stuff done even in the face of inevitable setbacks and failures?
    - If the project was a team project, look for signs that they took a leadership role. A candidate might say, “We were working on X, but the boss said Y and the client said Z.” I’ll ask, “So what did you do?” A good answer to this might be “I got together with the other members of the team and wrote a proposal” A bad answer might be, “Well, there was nothing I could do. It was an impossible situation.” Remember, Smart and Gets Things Done. The only way you’re going to be able to tell if somebody Gets Things Done is to see if historically they have tended to get things done in the past. In fact, you can even ask them directly to give you an example from their recent past when they took a leadership role and got something done—overcoming some institutional inertia, for example.


- **Passion for tech and metacognition about coding**
    - Do you think about how to code well? Nerd out about stuff. Show you're proud of what you've done, you're amped about what they're doing, and you have opinions about languages and workflows.
    - Have at least one example of an interesting technical problem you solved
    - story about what you should have done differently in a past project
    - piece of trivia about your favorite language, and something you do and don't like about said language
    -  Question about the company's engineering strategy (testing, Scrum, etc)
    -  Qquestion about the company's product/business



- **Team Player** 
    - Can you bring out the best in those around you? Can your presence bring out the best qualities in your peers? Can you inspire them with your positive energy, or will you drag them down with your grouchiness? Are you someone whom your colleagues look forward to seeing every day at work? Do you help make them better and happier at their jobs? Are you a positive multiplier for your coworkers?
    - An example of an interpersonal conflict you overca

- **Leadership**: Have you led a team? What size team? Was your role as leader formal or informal? How did it go? How do you act as a leader? Are you skilled? What is your style? If they're doing their job, you can't fake any of this. But you can make sure that you effectively convey the information they're looking for. 
    + example of leadership or ownership
    For example: “In my last role, I was the informal lead of our 5 person project team building a widget. We were executing poorly so I focused on building a culture of accountability through clear goals everyone agreed on. One person didn't like that and left, which is fine. In the end we shipped our feature on time and customers liked it.”
    - In 4 sentences you've answered the interviewer’s 5 implicit questions, and you've landed the message that you are someone who believes in strong accountability. Some people talk for 20 minutes and don't convey nearly as much information! With their key questions answered, the interviewer will be relaxed, engaged and receptive to the rest of what you have to say. Ownership/leadership. Do you see your work through to completion? Do you fix things that aren't quite right, even if you don't have to?

**Prepare notes on why you find a company exciting and show enthsiasm**. You can even reference the notes during the interview. Bringing prepared notes shows preparation.  The best approach is to prepare notes before an interview about what you find exciting about the company, and bring this up with each interviewer when they ask if you have any questions. A good source of ideas is to read the company’s recent blog posts and press releases and note the ones you find exciting. Convince the company it’s your dream job.   Employees who are excited about the mission of a company will work harder and be happier, and companies know this. And **practice.**[^practice] 

----


**Practice mock interviews with feedback**

If you have never jumped off an airplane before, the thought of skydiving will be positively frightening. But if you have already skydived one hundred times, while you might still feel the rush, you will no longer feel the same panic as you did the first time. Hence, the best way to handle the nerve caused by interviews is to go through more interviews. Very few performers will get on stages without practices. The more you interview, the more comfortable you will get. Everything else will follow when you just chill out and convey your thoughts clearly. 

- You have to convert from thinking silently. 
    
    - Make sure you specifically instruct your mock interviewers to call you out when you start to think silently
    - You can hire professionals to conduct mock interviews with you, or you can find friends & family to fill the role. Just keep in mind that with friends and families you'll have to do more grunt work for them to be helpful to you.
    - Your goal isn't to simulate the whole session, at least not until the very end. In the beginning, your goal is to get feedback as soon as possible, so you can quickly correct and incorporate the feedback into your responses. It generally is easier to have real time feedbacks, but for group interview it might be best to have people jot down the feedback during a 15 minute question period followed by 15 minute critiques, rather than continuously interrupting the flow of the session.

 - For the nontrivial questions that you have to "think" about - apply the process to subdivide your thinking and share them. Your interviewers will thank you. You'll thank yourself.
    -  Eventually you would want to conduct a full session end-to-end after enough small practices. Throughout the session you should ensure that the feedback has become increasingly positive. This will give you a visible improvement progress that can boost your confidence. 
    -  It is critical to either whiteboard problems with someone or mock a phone interview with someone. It’ll be awkward. That’s the point. If it were natural you wouldn’t need to practice it, would you? If you start practicing on the phone or on a whiteboard and it’s embarrassing or awkward, it’s a sign you’re doing exactly what you should be: practicing. It was pretty awkward for me until it wasn’t, and the practice absolutely paid off 
    -  Practicing with a friend. Whether on a whiteboard or on something like Codeshare, simulating an interview environment with someone over a period of time takes a lot of the scariness out of interviews. You get over the awkwardness of verbalizing something totally stupid to someone because your brain slipped. The best is if you can make sure someone understands a problem you haven’t seen before, as they can give you hints to push you toward a solution. Seriously, that kind of practice is invaluable.
    -  Especially with the pressure of an interview. Practice with a friend on a whiteboard with a 45–60 minute time constraint. Then ask for direct feedback. I’d even record it, watch it later and see how you discussed certain things. Then reverse the roles. Sometimes, you’ll learn more being the interviewer. Not to take it to extremes, but consider teaching it to a friend or two. This is often how you absorb information at a faster rate.

# At The Interview

**Composure is key. It's better to answer fewer questions in more thorough detail than to get through every question the interviewer may have had on his list to ask you.**

- Be neat, cogent and presentable.
- Warm up your voice.  For interview purposes, a short conversation or a little singing should do the trick. You don't want to sound tired, burned out, or bored. 
- Speak slowly: one of the outward signs of anxiety is the tendency to bulldoze past others. We all tend to speed up when we're nervous or excited. This is a basic primitive - showing the the person that you are capable of seeing things from their perspective.
- Be mindful: listen to yourself. Take a moment in an interview to consider how you sound and be sure you're not talking too loud or too fast.
-  Maintain eye contact.
-  Concentrate on listening, but also engage with the interviewer. Show passion and interest.  Bring a high energy version of yourself," as it shows you're genuinely interested and curious about solving problems together.  Find this interesting, please. Get excited, enthusiastic. Yes it’s probably a made up problem, and yes it’s an interview, but if you can’t enjoy it, you don’t belong in this industry. This balance between composure and energy is delicate.

**In the first few minutes of chit-chat with the interviewer: explain any sort of experience which sets you apart (as the interview progresses, start focussing on them - their problems to solve, but start of with this). [Relevant projects][How to talk about projects], significant technical accomplishments, credentials.** 

 The person conducting the interview has interviewed dozens if not hundreds of smart people just like you. So what can you say that would surprise them?


*   Name-drop credentials (degree from a famous school) as a demonstration of “I am smart and can get  stuff done”
*  Being sure to mention working in multiple programming languages.
*  Credible ccomplishments: Have you done something noteworthy to give you external credibility in your line of work? Do the best people in your profession respect and value what you do? Even if you don't have the proper credentials, you can still get good jobs if your work is outstanding enough to attract the interest of well-respected senior colleagues in your field. They can give you personal referrals to prime opportunities.

**"Tell me about yourself". This question is more about the interviewer: why you are a perfect fit for the hole in the organization they have? Frame your answer around what they're looking to see from you (hint: brevity and relevance to the job). Make your pitch and sell it.**

-----


**Be the person would you want to hire if you were hiring for your startup.** Aim high. **Don’t strive to merely clear the bar, strive to set it.**

There’s a big difference between “barely good enough” and “absolutely good enough”. Strive for the latter!  If you get to a point where you think you know enough to get an offer, that’s great. Interview performance obviously helps decide if you get an offer from a given company, but it also helps decide what that offer looks like. 

Can you make whoever hired you look good? Everybody wants to feel good about who they hired. Nobody wants to be responsible for a dud hire who makes their group, division, or department look bad to their peers. Can you be someone whom your boss and senior colleagues are proud to show off? This doesn't mean you should be a brown-noser or sycophant; often the best way to make people around you look good is to be great at your own work.

Be charismatic: Charisma isn't a requirement for most jobs, but it will make it much easier to convince people to hire you. You'll also be a more valued employee since you'll be able to more easily make whoever hired you look good and bring out the best in those around you, which are the other two qualities of a strong job candidate besides “Can you get stuff done?

Another key conceptual point to keep in mind the fact that while many of these tests are presented as being nominally objective, when in fact their bigger purpose is really psychological -- the interviewer really is just trying to see whether they can "vibe" with you in this interaction as much as whether you are coming up with the right answers. So another thing you want to try priming yourself with (rather than meds) is an an air of simple humility, rather than defensiveness, or again, a need to be seen as always "right" or "worthy" of their assessments.



To keep in mind:  Do not mistake arrogance for confidence. You demonstrate confidence when you are comfortable (not to be confused with complacency) with what you don't know, and showing intellectual curiosity/eagerness to learn.

**Be structured and organized in all communications**


-  Explain things well, at whatever level. If you talk about a previous project, explain it in terms that a normal person could understand. Often CS majors will just assume that everyone knows what Bates Theorem is or what O(log n) means. You have to be smart enough to comprehend what it takes to make other people understand their idea. Smart people can generally tell if they’re talking to other smart people by having a conversation with them on a difficult or highly technical subject, and the interview question is really just a pretext to have a conversation on a difficult subject so that the interviewer’s judgment can form an opinion on whether this is a smart person or not.  

**Explicitly check on their response to your words: “Is this making sense to you?**

##### How to talk about projects

- Choose a project that produced results, and highlight the results. This often involves picking a less technically interesting project, but it’s worth it. Think (ahead of time) of the programming you’ve done that had the largest real-world impact. If you’ve written a iOS game, and 50k people have downloaded it, the download number makes it a good option. If you’ve written an admin interface during an internship that was deployed to the entire admin staff, the deployment makes it a good thing to talk about. Selecting a practical project will also communicate to the company that you focus on actual work. Programmer too focused on interesting tech is an anti-pattern that companies screen against (these programmers are sometimes not productive). Be ready to field detailed questions about the technology used and how you used it. Also about what role you played. Sole developer? Developer on a team? Show that you know what you were doing and havn't exaggerated their your roles. 


---

**Frame the interaction with the right metaphors.**

**A role-playing exercise where you are pretending to be coworkers trying to solve problems together**

Or is it a one-sided "test" where you are put on a spot to defend yourself?  

You'd be the one leading the problem solving, but being capable to explain your thought process effectively, having the ability to exchange ideas with the interviewer, and just being able to come across as a good teammate is probably more important than getting that last 5% of optimization. This is especially more true for senior level position interviews where there are more design/architecture problems with relatively open answers. 


Remember, they want to hire you! The life-blood of any software company is its employees. It's looking to hire the best and the brightest and the people conducting the interview want you to succede just as much as you do.

**You're hiring them**
Get past the very idea that this is a one-way process, whereby it's supposedly just you who has to prove their (intellectual, economic) worthiness to others (whose own credentials completely beyond question). In fact you might want to start practicing the complete opposite of this mindset -- just walk in there as if it's you who is contemplating whether to hire them (which in essence is true anyway -- as all truly desirable working situations are two-way streets), and has plenty of other options available if this particular situation doesn't work out. (Paul Graham has a few good paragraphs about this).



**Think of it as a game you are playing**


Interview questions are easy if you are confident in your abilities, have all the time in the world, and look at problems as a game. They’re hard if you encounter them in an interview, or while preparing for interviews. If you don’t see a solution immediately, it’s easy to think you’re not good enough, and that can easily distract you from finding a solution. That doesn’t happen if you’re doing it for fun. 

When we are young, stage fright is an unknown experience. Look at how little kids are able to perform in front of audience without much concern, and even though they might not be great performers, their joy and lack of stage fright is something that all adult performers work hard to reclaim. Can we do what little kids do? Yes we can - by stop being concerned about our performances. Allow Yourself The Room To Suck. "Perfect is the enemy of good."  — Voltaire. 




Nerves are caused by one reason - you are focusing on yourself, instead of focusing on others. It's perfectly normal, of course, to focus on ourselves. However, during performance time, focusing on oneself achieves the opposite effect of what we actually want. It causes us to freeze in action and actually end up performing worse, potentially creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. Such focus is due to fear of failure. In interview situations, in wanting to put the best foot forward, we often end up shooting ourselves in the foot when we are so focused on being perfect.

Little kids do not know what being perfect is - kids *are* perfect, period. Anything they do is fine, and their enthusiasm/optimism carry the day. Adults have more standards to live by, of course.  But by not being concerned about how well you perform, you'll automatically be more relaxed, and actually end up performing better. 




----

**Them, not You. Any question you ask and everything you say should be framed from the perspective of the employer and for the benefit of the employer.**



It's actually a bit trickier than "stop worrying about how well you will perform" though. Because whenever we tell ourselves not to think of something, that something is exactly what we end up thinking about.

What we need to do instead is to have "something else" replacing the "original something".

The best "something else" in interview situation is to think about how you can help others, by focusing on answering the following questions

* How can you help the company? or What do you need me to get done in the first couple of months on the job?
	- Lead with this question. Add that you want to hit the ground running. Ask clarifying questions about anything you can do before you even get to the job. Take lots of notes as the employer responds.

* What problems are they trying to solve? or What's the biggest challenge for the team right now?
	- Shows you see your success as team success. Forces interviewer to level psychologically with you. Opportunity to reveal a niche where you have advantage over other candidates. Doubles down on showing your performance focus.


* How will you help solve their problem?  Talk about skills you bring to the table.

* What intangibles will benefit your new employer?

* Are you the right person to help them?  Ask what are the top features on my resume that made you want to hire me?
	- Makes the interviewer think past the sale & highlight your highest-value skills with one's own words. Reveals what you might want to emphasize in rest of interview & any subsequent round.


* How many people have you hired in the past six months and in what positions?

This tells you where the company is growing and potential areas where you can help if positions are unfilled. Make that explicit as appropriate. Shows interest in success & future of the company.


 

* What are the common attributes of your most successful projects, employees etc.?

Suggests you want to be a top performer and are actively looking for fit with the team. Opportunity to reveal & highlight niche skill of yours. Psychological association between you & top doers.


*  What is the biggest shortcoming among other candidates for the job?

	- Makes the interviewer focus on your competitors weaknesses. May reveal advantages to talk about for rest of interview & any subsequent rounds. Levels the interviewer with you psychologically.


* How do you typically unwind from work? What do you do in your spare time?

	- Shows personal interest & allows the interviewer to talk about his/her favorite subject - oneself. Creates psychological association with something enjoyable (vacation, hobby etc.). Levels you together.


* How does the company plan to deal with [insert competitive or other threat]?
	- Shows you know the market and the environment, the direction of the industry overall. Shows interest in future of the company & you've made an effort to prep for the interview. Levels you together.



* How did you get the position you're at (what skills, achievements etc.)?
	- Prompts the interviewer to talk about him/herself, esp. one's successes. Suggests interest in career at the company/industry & how the firm works on the "people" level. Seeds opportunity to compliment.



* What's the most important internal driver of performance for the organization?
	- Shows you get that the dynamics of any organization are driven by something other than the P&L. Is it successful because focus on cost? Quality? Customer service? Then link to your own strengths.


The more you think in this fashion, the less you'll be concerned about your own performance, and the more value your interviewers will actually find you bring to the table.

The goal in the interview is to immediately add value. Why else would they be hiring you? Always focus on the other party. You'll reduce your own fear, and actually make others like you more than otherwise.


**Be Willing to Walk Away**
The by-product of focusing on helping others is this - if you are not the right person, you should be willing to walk away. Think of it this way - if you are the wrong person, you might actually end up causing more problems. You don't want to be the person that cause others more problems if you really are trying to help. Hence - willingness to walk away signifies true desire to help others. And if you are willing to walk away - what is the reason to fear?



---


**Dealing with Rejection**

 The Zen of dealing with it is NOT to question the rejection; but rather to consider it as a data point: a kind of a failed trade, or a missed sale -- something to learn from, definitely but not (intrinsically) as a sign that your "product" is (ie, you are) damaged goods, per se. And so to the see the rejection as being something fundamentally good (despite the near-term financial and other costs), insofar as it at least teaches you something.

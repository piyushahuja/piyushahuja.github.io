**Virality** 

The only two dating sites in the world that have attained true virality are Badoo and Tinder. A few others have attained rapid exponential growth through some complex dynamic including a large advertising spend. But in every one of these cases, the result has been a massively degraded experience verging on soft porn, disturbingly spammy tactics, and a userbase with very low lifetime values relative to match.com. 

With the unicorn exception of Tinder, the only way to attain virality in dating (discovered thus far) is to aggressively (read: deceptively?) capture the user’s email address book and spam the entire list. Basically: block the feeling that the user might find love (or, more to the point: sex) with a tricky address book capture. If your goal is to create a dating site that isn’t solely about finding sex and that has the potential to become a well-respected national or international brand with high subscription revenues, virality has, to-date, been nearly impossible to achieve. I’ve met with two or three dozen people in the last few years thinking about starting dating sites. Of these, maybe 90% have believed in some magic virality system. Of these, none have achieved magic. - Aaron Schildkrout, founder of How About We

**City-by-city expansion** - [Andew Chen](http://andrewchen.co/why-investors-dont-fund-dating/)

Dating products inherently rely on a local marketplace, and bootstrapping a series of marketplaces is very hard, and expensive. People are willing to travel to meet each other, but only so much. And there needs to be the right mix of male/female participants (or whatever permutation makes sense). To make this work, each city needs to get spun up the same way that on-demand services are spun up, which is one of the reasons why local expansion has remained expensive and unscalable.

**Events** We often see dating products continually hold a series of unscalable events/parties/etc in a city to get things going. Until there’s word-of-mouth, and enough people to generate a quality experience, the marketplace will suck.

**Paid Acquisition / Direct Marketing**



*Challenge*

For dating, this is by far the most interesting category. It is the ONLY strategy that has ever worked to build a truly mainstream dating brand over time, with the sole exceptions of OKCupid (whose primary strategy was being free and which took nearly a decade to attain true scale) and possibly Tinder. 

Very few consumer web companies talk in their very early stages about buying traffic as a core part of their customer acquisition strategy (though this is changing). This relative absence is indicative — more than anything else — of the belief in magic. Advertising is the only reliable, scalable, predictable way of acquiring users for mainstream dating sites.

For those who do include direct acquisition in their strategy, there is usually a massive underestimation of the amount of work required for hardcore funnel and LTV optimization. Building a truly effective CRM alone is years of work, and this is just one piece of the optimization required to even begin to compete for positive ROIs with the major dating advertisers in the world (match.com , for example, spends hundred(s) of millions of dollars each year on ads; you can be sure their conversion funnel is fairly well-optimized).
So, either the absence of a paid acquisition strategy or the presence of one that underestimates what optimizing a conversion funnel really takes both echo the magical beliefs that pervade most early distribution plans.

An ad click if you search for online dating - a CLICK - often costs over $5. match.com 


 > Unless you're in a market where products are as undifferentiated as cigarettes or vodka or laundry detergent, spending a lot on brand advertising is a sign of breakage.


Dating app as in mobile or site? If its mobile its tricky, AdMob is terrible with doing performance marketing as effective as other mediums. 

Personally, I would suggest international (depending on your payment providers). Why? Cheaper clicks, easier to get market saturation, less competition. Pay some international student to do translation and pay 'em $50 for the day

Your goal at the end of the day is geographic targeting (regardless of the country). The more concentrated your efforts the better. If its the US — NYC is good, SF and LA are also good too. 

Also a good idea (assuming your site is pieced together) I would suggest spending money faster. 20k across a few months might mean a few hundred people a day but if you spend it across a few weeks you will have a better initial user base. Depending on your targeting you can loose a lot of users fast. If you have a fast growing database its easier to have a higher "stick" and your conversion to paid (assuming its subscription) will be higher as more communication will be going back and forth.

Or “Attitudinal” factors build upon demographics to define more characteristics of what a target market thinks, feels and does. For example, several years ago I was consulting for British supermarket Sainsbury’s, who were at the time battling with (Walmart-owned) Asda for the position of second largest supermarket in the UK, behind Tesco. While the potential market for Sainsbury’s was the ~62 million people that lived in the UK, Sainsbury’s could not afford the media spend to reach everyone.

Instead Sainsbury’s worked to define a subset “Mindset audience” of approximately 12mm people that they felt “should” be shopping at Sainsbury’s. The mindset audience was constrained to people that agreed with attitudinal values that Sainsbury’s exhibited, such as “I believe it is worth paying extra for organic food” and 10 or so other points that would identify an ideal shopper from among the masses. This psychographic classification was used to focus media spend, which at the time was largely “offline” media, but now could be done much more effectively with digital media thanks to ad platforms.


> Now I know that data exchanges and retargeting are not everyone’s cup of tea, but I love them. As a consumer I get to see more relevant ads, and as a marketer, I love the ability to reach only people that have previously done something that suggests that they might be a potential customer for my product.

> When I led digital for Audi of America at AKQA, we were able to use information collected from data exchanges and DMP’s to understand which type of car a visitor might be interested in BEFORE they even visited any Audi-owned presences at all. So if a person had configured say a BMW M3 on an auto industry site, we could show them an Audi RS5 on a display ad that could follow them around the web, or even their very first arrival to our site.

> The opportunity here is to look for signals where customers may be unconsciously identifying and segmenting themselves in a useful way. For example, we could use this information to send a test message to only new customers that seemed interested in a small Coupé, and not include the larger markets of sedans and SUV’s.

When slicing a market by behavior, ensure that you don’t confuse buying stage, or purchase intent within the mix. For example, unit economics learnt from the coupé market may provide helpful benchmarks before scaling up to sedans, but the CAC for customers that have configured a car, will probably be much healthier than CAC for customers that have not yet configured a car, as the the former probably has much more purchase intent and is easier to convert.

**Influencers**


**Playbook**

1. Make a list of influencers/bloggers who are most likely going to feature your product with [BuzzSumo](http://buzzsumo.com/) or [Traackr](http://traackr.com/).
2. Engage the influencers/bloggers on social media by RT/favourite/reply to their content. Offer value first (think about the reciprocity principle.
3. Timing and relevancy is everything. If they have written about something that is related to your product or industry, reach out and start the dialogue.
4. Give them exclusive invite or offer to try out your product (e.g. lifetime pro membership, free first year subscription etc).
5. If they like it, ask them to write about it. Make their lives easier by providing 5 to 10 bullet points as to why people use it.
6. Minimize friction further by offering to write the blog post for them.
7. Continue to build the relationship and engagement.
8. Form something like this: [Apple Masters: Early Group of Apple Endorsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleMasters)




**Examples**

> Zynga with Friends even teamed up with Lady Gaga to send ten winners who played Gaga's word of the day to one of her shows.

> Skillshare attracted some high profile personas in the tech space like who offer classes via the platform. The biggest boost might come from Fred Wilson who announced today that he will teach [MBA Mondays](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/08/mba-mondays-live-and-skillshare.html) at the Union Square Ventures event space. Those classes will also be streamed live and recorded. The attendee fee will be donated to charity.

> What really helps in the recruitment process is that most masters who have devoted their lives to learning and practicing a difficult skill want to share what they’ve learned with others. For the most part, our instructors have had mentors who helped them along the way, and as a result they’re really excited for an opportunity to do the same for students. Kevin Spacey said he felt like it was his responsibility to “send the elevator down” for the next generation of actors. It sometimes feels like the impulse to teach is an integral part of being a master -- they love seeing the work of the next generation.

**PR**



*Challenge:*

Press: About 3 months into launching HowAboutWe we had a full-page front-page print article in the New York Times Sunday Styles section. It was literally the best non-TV press we could have gotten. It drove more traffic than we’d ever had by about 10x. It was an awesome achievement at that stage. Four years later, while an article like that would have been great, it would have driven a nearly indiscernible increase in traffic. It would be a cool, small, irrelevant bump. For early stage startups we were probably in the top 2 percentile for press converge. And this was key for branding and so on. But it was categorically NOT a business-creating source of traffic. This is very hard to understand for new entrepreneurs. They imbue press — like most things — with a magical aura of inexplicable growth creating powers.
Well, congratulations on it. I can’t end this without saying thank you to Stella for introducing us. Stella Garber is amazing.
*Michael*: I had my eye on her for a long time. I had worked with her or I had seen her and talked to her and seen what she had done at a previous company. I knew when I started Trello I had to get her.
*Andrew*: For PR, you mean, you saw what she did there?
*Michael*: Yeah. I remember poking at that over the years. There was never like a right position for her. But when it came up… she had a startup at the time that she was working on. So, it took a little bit of convincing. But I’m really excited to be working with her.
*Andrew*: I’ve always been amazed by the way she promotes the companies she works with. It’s a human touch that also understands my position. I wanted to have you on, but how do I have you on? How do I tell her I’m not sure what to do with this? Well, she totally understood and she said, “Look, here’s the angle that we could take and here’s some research that will help make this into a great interview,” which I now have on my screen here.
For anyone who hasn’t seen her, her name used to be before she got married Stella Fayman. She did one of the first Mixergy courses where she taught how she gets publicity for the companies she works with. You’ve got to go and watch it. She’s fantastic. If you ever get to go see her at a conference, go see her.

**Turn every conversation with the media into a conversation about the vision:**

“What makes a company like Uber get covered is not the fact that it’s a taxi service; it’s the story that Uber is completely changing the transportation industry. If companies like Uber only talked about what they did now, they’d be boring and they’d only get a fraction of the media coverage.”

When you’re a startup just getting traction, you can’t offer the salary and benefits that a world-class employee would normally get at a large company. You haven’t accomplished a lot that you can talk to the media about. So, what you’re always selling is the sizzle; not the steak. The sizzle is your vision!”

Quarterly Vision Document Emails* Herold advises his clients to send out the vivid vision quarterly to their customers, “90% clients may not care, but even if just a few do, you’ll be able to take your relationship to a whole new level.”

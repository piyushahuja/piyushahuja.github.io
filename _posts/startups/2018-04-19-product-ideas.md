Creative insights are not as rare as one thinks; what is rare is for people to have the conviction, and courage to act on them. Most people have insights. However, it is common for peopel to not listen to their insights, when faced with something original and real, they shy away, instead embracing the comfort and security of the tried-and-tested. Listening to your insight, or intution, is a practiced skill, and if not practiced it is dulled to the extent that one is not able to tell their own thoughts from others. Mimicry and other people's ideas start feeling as if they are your own; compare, for example, the authentic writing of an artist to the cliched, conventional vocabulary of a suit.

To not act on your product insights is as big risk for entrepreneurs as not listening to their feelings is for artists or not to listen to their moral convictions for political reformers. 

What do product insights look like? 

One is reminded of this iconic scene from [The Social Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdjGiIn9HMM). However, it doesn't have to be as dramatic as that. More veridically, Mark Zuckerberg talks about how people frequently changing their profile picture led to the insight that strong demand for a service that people could share more photos, which became a key differentiator and frquenly used feature. [Starting at 13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bJi7k-y1Lo). Sharing photos on the social network might seem ubiquitious now, but it wasn't back in the early days.





Here are a couple of examples from Instagram...


> Early on, there was a San Francisco Giants playoff game taking place at AT&T Park, near the company’s offices. As Systrom recalls, this led to another aha moment: “We were hearing the roars of home runs, not feeling like we were actually there,” he recalls. “We did an ad hoc [search] within the database to see if anyone was using Instagram in the area, and there were 140 photos in the last two hours taken in the stadium, so we could see the game [through the app]. . . . And that was the moment we realized Instagram could be far more than photo sharing.”


> On a beach walk one day, Nicole told him she would be reluctant to use the app he was working on because her pictures would never be as good as the ones a mutual friend took. “I said, ‘Well, you know what he does to those photos, right?’ She’s like, ‘No, he just takes good photos.’ I’m like, ‘No, no, he puts them through filter apps.’ She’s like, ‘Well, you guys should probably have filters too, right, then?’ I was like, ‘Huh.’ ” “Like,” indeed. Systrom went back to his hotel room and scoured the Internet, trying to figure out how to make a filter. That day, he created the first, which he called X-Pro II, after the “cross-processing where you take the wrong chemicals for the wrong film and you put them together.” He and Nicole started taking pictures using the filter and posted the first Instagram photo in this unusual style of a little Mexican dog lying next to Nicole’s foot. Once they had the filters, they aimed to launch the new service in just eight weeks.


Insights could be quantitative and come from recording user behavior and data. Here's a cute anecdote often told didactively in business school classes: 

> “When they first built the University of California at Irvine they just put the buildings in. They did not put any sidewalks, they just planted grass. The next year, they came back and put the sidewalks where the trails were in the grass.”

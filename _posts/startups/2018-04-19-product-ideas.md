Creative insights are not as rare as one thinks; what is rare is for people to have the conviction, and courage to act on them. Most people have insights. However, it is common for peopel to not listen to their insights, when faced with something original and real, they shy away, instead embracing the comfort and security of the tried-and-tested. Listening to your insight, or intution, is a practiced skill, and if not practiced it is dulled to the extent that one is not able to tell their own thoughts from others. Mimicry and other people's ideas start feeling as if they are your own; compare, for example, the authentic writing of an artist to the cliched, conventional vocabulary of a suit.

To not act on your product insights is as big risk for entrepreneurs as not listening to their feelings is for artists or not to listen to their moral convictions for political reformers. 



> Early on, there was a San Francisco Giants playoff game taking place at AT&T Park, near the company’s offices. As Systrom recalls, this led to another aha moment: “We were hearing the roars of home runs, not feeling like we were actually there,” he recalls. “We did an ad hoc [search] within the database to see if anyone was using Instagram in the area, and there were 140 photos in the last two hours taken in the stadium, so we could see the game [through the app]. . . . And that was the moment we realized Instagram could be far more than photo sharing.”


On a beach walk one day, Nicole told him she would be reluctant to use the app he was working on because her pictures would never be as good as the ones a mutual friend took. “I said, ‘Well, you know what he does to those photos, right?’ She’s like, ‘No, he just takes good photos.’ I’m like, ‘No, no, he puts them through filter apps.’ She’s like, ‘Well, you guys should probably have filters too, right, then?’ I was like, ‘Huh.’ ” “Like,” indeed.Systrom went back to his hotel room and scoured the Internet, trying to figure out how to make a filter. That day, he created the first, which he called X-Pro II, after the “cross-processing where you take the wrong chemicals for the wrong film and you put them together.” He and Nicole started taking pictures using the filter and posted the first Instagram photo in this unusual style of a little Mexican dog lying next to Nicole’s foot. Once they had the filters, they aimed to launch the new service in just eight weeks.



The goal of your first time user experience is to:

(1) Prevent them from abandoning the app
(2) Communicating your key value proposition in their heads
(3) Teaching them how to use the app
(4) Making them go “wow”


“When they first built the University of California at Irvine they just put the buildings in. They did not put any sidewalks, they just planted grass. The next year, they came back and put the sidewalks where the trails were in the grass. Perl is just that kind of language. It is not designed from first principles. Perl is those sidewalks in the grass.”



WOW is achieved when a user recognizes, either quite actively or subconsciously, that your product or service is a must have experience that will improve her life. It’s something powerful enough to make users say, “Wow, this is awesome.”

Some things to keep in mind about WOW factors: 
* They’re often not a feature. But rather, what that feature makes possible.
* They convey much more value than effort required - (i.e. they are Low Effort, High Value, or LEHV, activities)
* They are powerful when communicated with examples or analogies, but even more powerful when the result of real user interaction. Always remember, Do>Show>Tell.


The answer is (4). (3) is necessary for (4), but not sufficient. So (4) encapsulates (2). (2) encapsulates (3). and (4) entails (1) is satisfied. 


A set of clearly outlined steps to completion/registration is key for a successful FTUE.
“uncertain, unexplained waits feel longer than known, finite waits.” The more structured and clear the remaining time and number of steps remaining are, the more likely a user will be patient enough to go through and complete all of the steps required to get through the FTUE.

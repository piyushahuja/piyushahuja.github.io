* **Prevent them from abandoning the app**. 

A set of clearly outlined steps to completion/registration is key. The more structured and clear the remaining time and number of steps remaining are, the more likely a user will be patient enough to go through and complete all of the steps required to get through the FTUE. “uncertain, unexplained waits feel longer than known, finite waits.”

* **Communicate your key value proposition in their heads**
* **Teach them how to use the app.**
* **Make them go “wow”**

Wow is achieved when a user recognizes, either quite actively or subconsciously, that your product or service is a must have experience that will improve her life. It’s something powerful enough to make users say, *“Wow, this is awesome.”*

Some things to keep in mind about WOW factors: 

* They’re often not a feature. But rather, what that feature makes possible.
* They convey much more value than effort required - (i.e. they are Low Effort, High Value activities)
* They are powerful when communicated with examples or analogies, but even more powerful when the result of real user interaction. Do > Show > Tell.

**First-Time User Experience**

The goal of your first time user experience is to:

* Prevent them from abandoning the app
* Communicating your key value proposition in their heads
* Teaching them how to use the app. 
* A set of clearly outlined steps to completion/registration is key for a successful FTUE. “uncertain, unexplained waits feel longer than known, finite waits.”  The more structured and clear the remaining time and number of steps remaining are, the more likely a user will be patient enough to go through and complete all of the steps required to get through the FTUE.
* Making them go “wow” . WOW is achieved when a user recognizes, either quite actively or subconsciously, that your product or service is a must have experience that will improve her life. It’s something powerful enough to make users say, “Wow, this is awesome.” Some things to keep in mind about WOW factors: 
    * They’re often not a feature. But rather, what that feature makes possible.
    * They convey much more value than effort required - (i.e. they are Low Effort, High Value, or LEHV, activities)
    * They are powerful when communicated with examples or analogies, but even more powerful when the result of real user interaction. Do > Show > Tell.

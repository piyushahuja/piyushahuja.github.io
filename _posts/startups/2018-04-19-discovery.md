**The Problem: The very concept attracts *Sketchy People***

If your product is purely, explicitly about dating  - without any other utility , you'd fail to attract the right crowd. People who are highly valued in the dating market have little trouble finding dates in the real world, and to attract them you need to provide an additional hook - like the appeal of learning something new.

**What do people have to say?**

> Having a profile almost spells like red-flag. Perhaps I’m prejudiced about this, but if you haven’t got anyone interested in you in your day-to-day activities and you interact with at least a decent amount of people (I can forgive my friends in Antarctica). Then something might not be alright with you or the people around you. I get that some people might have a hard time dealing with social situations or get a little anxious from interpersonal interaction, yet that won’t go away when coming back to real life. Sooner or later you’ll need a handful of fresh air to deal with it. In Tinder and other sites everything is implying a 1-to-n relation. I’m not saying casual is bad, it’s just that when you meet somebody and they are basically gouging the market for “fun and profit” an honest connection with them is the least you can expect.

> “The thing about dating services is that they work a lot better when they're not explicitly marketed as dating services. Facebook started out as a thinly veiled dating service, where the primary activities were looking up people you might want to date and communicating with them. But the product was marketed as a more general tool, even keeping the meaning of the "Poke" button rather cryptic. Instagram is in the same vein - a large use case is showing your friends and acquaintances how cool and attractive you are, with the goal of raising one's dating status. And Instagram is marketed towards making sunsets and pictures of flowers look better, allowing users to realize for themselves that a Gaussian blur might make their selfies look better too. Huge numbers of products are marketed towards increasing one's attractiveness in some way, whether shampoo or automobiles or clothing, and outside of Axe body spray, very few of them are explicit about it. There's no reason that websites wouldn't follow the same script.”

> Those that go searching for love only make manifest their own lovelessness, and the loveless never find love, only the loving find love, and they never have to seek for it.

> But how do you find out if that cute, smart, and young lawyer you stumbled upon on an app is actually what he claims to be and not some creepy wife-beater looking for some action on the side? *Non-monogamy is invisible.* **OkCupid has settings for non-monogamy and open relationships. I use them. Despite that I am frequently matched with people who are explicitly against what I want. And of the non-monogamous people I have dated, about half of them refuse to put their preferences online. It’s supposed to be a built-in feature. But it’s not used that way. I dislike the time and tact it takes to filter through all of these people.

>  Few people are as nasty in person as they can be online - but some are. I hate to give them the satisfaction of my response, but it’s demoralizing to be called names to your face.
        
> There is a dark underbelly to online dating that attracts spammers, con artists and those not suited for modern love. A recent lawsuit filed against Match levelled the claim that more than half of its profiles were inactive or fake, an accusation the company denies. Real-life users can be problematic, too. Stories of dates gone awry abound, ranging from the merely awkward to the truly creepy to the tragically abusive. A California woman sued Match after a sex offender she met on the site allegedly raped her. Match has since begun screening new members against the national sex offender registry.

> So my biggest qualm with online dating sites is that although you meet people you normally wouldn’t meet, you also meet people that you shouldn’t. There is no third party to vouch for their character. One of my good gentlemen friends met a professional woman online who seemed ideal. Fortunately, he’s smart: he hired a P.I. and found out that the woman had extorted a house out of another man, and the two were involved in a court battle. Another friend met a local guy who tried to get her to loan him money for a new business. Shameless. So although they aren’t Nigerian scammers, they’re scammers lite. In real life, they are avoidable. In real life, you’d typically meet someone through your social circle (friends, neighborhood, church, school). Because there is connectivity within your circle, you know who has a stellar reputation or a dodgy one. If you don’t know, you can always find out by asking around. You sure as heck already know if someone is married with kids (or if they’ve scammed money out of someone).
        * Ask around! If you are friends or acquaintances with anyone in their extended social circle, get a feel for their reputation.  Do routine checks to see if they’re still on the site or any others, at least for the first year. Some people hide their profiles, so you might have to get help from a tech-savvy friend.
> Ysabelle Cheung, a 26-year-old writer in NYC who has tried Hinge, Happn (a location-based app), OkCupid, and CMB, says,  "Have I been hurt? No. Have I been offended? Many times. I've been sent messages with bulging packages and penis heads, and, strangely, on one of them, I receive a lot of messages from men into BDSM. The messages that disturb me the most are the ones from guys asking if I want to violate them or hurt them—and they always say I look like I'd be into it!" women get bombarded by the online equivalent of dudes who shout “Nice tits, giz a smile” on the street? 

> “if you want to find the largest cluster of deluded liars, check out online dating sites. Many of these people could be done for violations of the trade description act if it applied to dating. For quite a lot of guys, it seems that making contact with a woman online means that it’s time to get their penis out, photograph it and send it to her.”  You get a load of winks and there is always one guy that takes umbridge about the fact that you didn’t wink back or get in touch with him

> Having previously encountered convicted felons on Tinder, 27-year-old marketing manager Katherine Carter, in Los Angeles, is now solely on Bumble. "Tinder feels more like a hook-up site—and the amount of unflattering guy selfies is pretty absurd. They ask for your cell phone number and then send you dick pics, and now this creep has your number,"

**What's the solution?**

* **Exlusion** by users, by women, or by money: Only allowing women to invite, or Invite only (The League), Only paid members (Aisle)
        * EHarmony: the ridiculously long personality quiz presents a high barrier to entry that filters out casual browsers and cheaters, and it provides enough info about long term plans to avoid early pitfalls of meeting someone you like only to find out you aren't compatible in fundamental but not first-date discussion ways (do you want kids, your thoughts on religion, etc.)

* **Reviews** from Parents (Muzmatch, Reviews from Friends (TrulyMadly), Reviews from other users (Lulu). 
    * Female users answer multiple-choice questions about a man’s sense of humor, manners, ambition, commitment level, and look and style. Results are converted to a 0-to-10 rating, which constitutes a guy’s “score”. Unlike other review-based systems, they cannot add their own comments.
    * The question is whether he can make the idea of rating other human beings as palatable in a dating app as it is in an app like Uber. When Peeple, the "Yelp for humans," was announced recently, there was an outpouring of anger from the media and the general public (http://www.businessinsider.com/peeple-app-is-a-terrible-idea-2015-10) . Lerner thinks part of that is because of the idea of rating anyone, even people who don't use the app. With Peeple or Lulu, you can blindside someone with a horrible review even though they never consented to the app in the first place. It feels invasive.  
    
    * It also has a feature where users can rate whether someone they have met via the app resembles their photo or not.
    
    * First, the ratings won't allow any freeform text. When confronted with someone's profile you'll be able to answer one question about them: "Is this a 'quality' person?" That's it. The thinking is that combing through a dating app to leave one bad "yes/no" user review on your ex doesn't seem particularly fun, even for the most vindictive among us. The Grade then takes the sum of all these "yes/no" answers and gives your profile a grade. Beyond the "grading," you'll also be able to pick from a list of pre-determined hashtags to describe someone, in a move that is similar to the girls-rate-boys app Lulu . This too is meant to control the trolls. If you are downloading The Grade, you know what you are getting yourself into, and you are choosing it because you want some accountability. And the way it is set up, the only risk you'd be subjecting yourself to is a few negative ratings in a general sense. The Grade lacks the specificity that can be the most stinging part of anonymous online gossip, which is essentially what apps like Lulu are. Lerner thinks that reviews, in some form, are the logical next step of dating apps. Someone has to deal with the fact that dating apps often devolve into an intensely hostile place for women, he says. He just doesn't know yet whether The Grade will be the app to crack the code.
* **Moderators (Coffee Meets Bagel, Dil Mil)**
            * To weed out fakes on her app, Kang implements monitors who keep watch. CMB curates matches, and only first names are revealed when a match is made with your "bagel" (sent daily at noon; you have 24 hours to bite or not).
            * Reporting misuse by users

* **Verification (Social Media, Manual)**

    * Tricks such as a real-time selfie requirement which time stamps photos, to try to avoid people posting out of date pictures for their profile. (The real-time selfie requirement is slightly undermined by the app auto-applying a filter to your selfie which can result in a slightly less than au natural shot but a smattering of ‘mood lighting’ is obviously intended.)

    * Dil Mil claims to perform multi-source verification based on external data sources to weed out fake profiles.
    
    * Trust Score with Verification from social media  (Truly Madly)
    
    * Phone calls (Aisle, Floh)
    
    * To find love on TrulyMadly, you will have to submit copies of identity cards like passport, driving license, or PAN 
         * (Permanent Account Number) card. The TrulyMadly team will verify the ID proofs, social media profiles, and employment records to make sure that you are who you claim to be. If you make the cut, you will get a trust score based on how much real data you have submitted. Then the app will do the matchmaking. That will be based on the psychological profile it drew from likes and dislikes you confessed as well as what is evident from your social network persona.
            * With women accounting for a quarter or less of people using dating apps, there’s a way to go. As part of the effort to make them feel safer, most apps subject men to a more stringent verification process including a double-check of marital status and assign them a higher ‘trust score’ if they provide a LinkedIn account and upload a government ID. Higher the trust score, more matches you will get. So girls and guys have an incentive to submit better and more ID proofs to raise their trust scores.
            * Tinder boasts (http://www.ibtimes.com/tinder-introduces-verified-accounts-notable-people-so-you-know-theyre-real-1997734) “verified accounts” for celebrities only. 
            * Bumble The app will soon grant checkmarks (well, bumblebees) to users who maintain a quick response time and message ratio, complete their profiles and have never been reported for inappropriate behavior.
            * e Grade -- an app that exposes how fast and often people respond to messages and the quality of these texts. The Grade scans users’ app use and assigns a letter-grade for all to see.

* **Solving by Design**
    * Wolfe's design was to make guys accountable for messages they send. "On Bumble, you can't send a photo without having your face and name attached to it"

* **Deemphasize private messages**
    * You can also create a group chat in the app, where you’re able to suggest an activity and poll the others for a preferred time. When the poll wraps, you can tap to turn the poll into an invite and another tap adds it to your calendar.
    
    * A friend of mine who has been helping me refine the pitch, as well as think through the product, created a group called "Date Ideas in SF". I thought it was a good potential use case for VoteChat, but didn't think that it would lead to much. I posted a comment about how my favorite date was a motorcycle ride to the twin peaks of San Francisco for an amazing view. I didn't check my phone for a few hours. A few hours later, when I check my phone, I see that my cofounder Felipe had left the idea "Homeless Shelter"

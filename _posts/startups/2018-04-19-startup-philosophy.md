**Form A Vision And Only Then Pick A Niche**

The conventional advice is to start with a niche. But before picking a niche, it is important to imagine the state of the world you want to achieve and work backward from that. Only then identity a niche which allows you to go down that path.[^Tinder][^Facebook]

This allows you to "solve for a niche with the added constraint that the solution is *scalable to what you want*"   

Picking a niche is a constraint. You can be creative within that one constraint. But if you pick a niche and a view to what you want to eventually become, that gives you **two constraints.** And constraints foster creativity. 


[^Tinder]: Tinder picked up a niche: hookups between frats and sororities. But that would ensure they are not able to scale to, say, OKCupid's niche, whereas the reverse is not true.

[^Facebook]: Paul Graham says FB for Harvard was a qualitative different product from the social network we know of it today. But to get to where it is today, it needed to be a Harvard site first. Growth is the one thing that takes you from here to there. But that's incorrect. FB could have taken a number of different paths, without comporomising on growth. But it took a particular path because there were other constraints added by what Zuckerberg's particular vision of FB's role in the world was.



**Solve For A Fundamental Human Need**

Technology changes, mediums change, products change, but the fundamental human needs remain the same, and people adapt to meet them.

The most common advice is "solve for the problem you yourself have". But the most successful dating company of our times, Match.com, was founded not by someone whose singledom was solved by it, but rather, ironically, a company which created a new problem in the happy life of its founder.

> "In 1995 most people weren’t online, and those that were weren’t finding dates there. So Kremen got everyone he knew to sign up for Match. He had all Match employees create profiles, and even though he was in a relationship, he signed up and had his girlfriend sign up, too. There was early success. A critical mass started using the site and online dating in the internet era was born. But it backfired in one important respect. Kremen’s own girlfriend met another man through Match and left him. It was a painful lesson, but at least he knew the site worked.""


**Curiosity, Conviction, Courage**


Be curious about ideas. Innovation requires the ability to differentiate between ideas that seem the same but aren’t.[^Myspace]  "Originality” is usually just ignorance of previous ideas.  People who have worked in the space for years and know the problems to solve would immediately see a good idea from bad.   If lots of other people are not trying something similar to you, your idea is probably a bad idea. 

Curiosity is also the root cause of ‘perseverance’.  In trying something that eventually doesnt work, one inevitably learns something. And learning is the goal of the curious. What many people see as failure, the curious as success, because their goals are different. Once you embrace curiosity, you do not fail even in your failures. "Fail fast" then becomes a motto not about the elusive goal of eventually succeeding, but about succeeding the most, because the faster you fail, the faster you learn.


[^Myspace]: For example, Facebook is a different idea than Myspace. Quora is a different idea than Yahoo Answers. Grasping the salience of these differences is where spotters fail, why investors fail, why ideas are not easy to copy, and why creativity seems so hard when ideas seem in abundance. 


Sometimes all genius is = **curiosity** which leads to the grasping the salience of difference of ideas + **conviction** on why your idea is right and others are wrong + **courage** to follow it through to the end and see that it hits the target with the right execution. 


- [Why trying new things is hard?](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/business/why-trying-new-things-is-so-hard.html)


**Find Your People**

Lay your market. Set your mission. It has to solve a problem. People would respond. Entrepreneurs working in the same space are your allies. Journalists reporting on the problem are your allies. Investors investing in this problem are allies (Make sure you have diverse set of investors, with different networks from different geographies)

Forget networking. Identify what people are trying to do, and if it kindles your heart, you see the problem they’re trying to solve,  help them with that. 
   
**Decide Your Focal Point**

Growth serves as a metric that helps you focus and prioritise. 

> When you lose everything, you get to know what to focus on, the real value of things - Rowling  


[^communism]: GDP has served as a metric of focus and prioritize (for capitalism). The value of GDP is in its being a substitute metric for "value creation for others”. But in some senses it could be a poor substite (in so far as it fails, because of short-termism, misuse etc.) [^communism] If communism is to succeed, we need a similar metric. Maybe communism fails precisely because it fails to provide such a metric to give people focus and direction and guidance and a metric around which to prioritise? Communism needs a metric which espouses its values and morality, just like GDP does for profit.


**Work In Idea Space And Incorporate Those Of Competitors**

The conventional advice is that observe behaviour of your active users, and build features which improves that experience, or recruit more users that do that. Don’t worry about competitors 

> Be steady at the wheel. The only way one startup can kill another startup is by getting into the other’s head and leading them off a cliff. If you don’t believe me, try this proof. Are your competitors releasing a bunch of the same features that you have on your roadmap? Yes? Do you know what consumers want*? No? Great, then neither do your competitors. Get back to figuring out what users want! *Hint: If you did, you would already have traction.

But this is precisely what sunk Myspace. 

> I think the main problem was really that they built their product for their most active users rather than asking themselves which products they needed to build to attract new users and engage inactive users. Facebook on the other hand seem to pay more attention to the popular features of their competitors than the requests of their active users. [Why did Myspace fall so fast and so far?](https://www.quora.com/Why-specifically-did-MySpace-fall-so-fast-and-so-far.)

See your competitors as allies, and incorporate their ideas. It is not a zero-sum game where your competitors eat from your pie. Rather, it is a "wealth creation game". Others are attempting to wealth, but are not “getting it”. They might be following a bad recipe, but you learning from then  - what worked for them and what didn’t. This prevent you from going down blind alleys. By draw from the the collective intelligence of the space, you can you get the right recipe and make a better pie (and a good meal) for all. 

**An Aesthetic of Harmony** 

What is a good aesthetic? A good aesthetic evokes a feeling of perfect *harmony*. But evoking a feeling of harmony is not just a matter of the visual design, but alo requires other features of your product to play well in synchrony: a perfect user journey, a sensitivity for the customer  (beware of the uncanny valley). A product which doesn't get harmony right is Facebook. When messenger pops up suggesting to initiate a message everytime a friend accepts my request, the idea of harmony is violated.  The whole Design -> UX -> Experience Architect trend is essentially a broadening the role of design to encapsulate the idea of ‘harmony’.

> Aesthetics really matter in the early stage. Spend time and/or money early on nailing a cool logo and beautiful slide template. It really matters. Even copying other beautiful stuff is fine. For getting our first 3/10/100 clients, the fact that we looked and sounded totally pro meant a lot. We seemed like a larger more innovative company because of it. Even for our Series A, the fact that our deck looked world-class helps build the belief. For hiring too it helps. People’s visual senses are easy to recruit to your cause and are powerful influencers. Why not look like you’re already a billion dollar company? I think this is under-optimized for in general even within the YC community. So many cool companies that scream SMALL TIME given their visual sense.

# Things To Keep In Mind

**Summary:** 
> Manufacture opportunity, catch luck, have an abundant mindset, prioritise high value activities, build and be mindful that most things compound.

**Compound Interest** Those who understand it, earn it; those who don’t, pay it.  Build on previous success (utilise network effects): Keep the power of incremental effort and network effects in mind. While the big award seems miles away and no amount of effort can take you there, making a small effort might lead to a small reward which in turn might set off a series of events which leads to the big reward.  Example: Winning Awards. It is easier to win multiple awards after winning your first one than it is to win a first one. In cases where a lot of things work out very well for somebody over a period of time it is generally a combination of luck, right place right time and success enables more success, strong mentors, hard work, resilience, and some natural ability combined. 

**Manufacture Opportunity.**  

 >  [Twitter founder] Stone created a lacrosse team in school since he was not good in other sports; he also landed his first job as a book cover designer by submitting a cover to the art director even though he was just interning as a delivery boy. 

**Catch Luck.** 
 
 > Luck is like Tour De France. You wait, and it flashes by you. You have to catch it while you can. - Amelie (the movie) 

**Prioritize high value activities** Skills needed at the top are different from skills needed at the bottom. You can skip the skills at the bottom altogether.  Concentrate on networking with top guys or Sports Competitions or Leadership Positions a la Zuzana, and not on petty things like Couchsurfing meets or cooking or bike repair or insecurities or past  etc. 

Build.**Ownership is essential to building wealth.**  It doesn’t matter what you own whether it’s intellectual property (i.e., books, creative work, etc.), equity in a company, or real estate. Let’s say that you have a job. While you’re at the job, you build a body of work outside of your day job (books, podcast, etc.). When you leave that job, you can take your body of work with you because you own it. “Earn with your mind, not time". There is pleasure in producing something that lasts, and in teaching (and understanding). Money will follow expertise. Don’t worry. Do not define your decisions by others (neither rebel nor conform)  
Abundance and Limitless Ambition:  To have a daring imagination. Multiple all your ideas by 10000x and see it looks lik All founders face obstacles. However, only those founders who envision a future where those challenges have been resolved have a high probability of successfully addressing them. Where others see potential I want to see potential, where others see obstacles I want to see opportunities, and instead of challenges I want to see a chance to create breakthrough solutions.  To become formidable, you need to have conviction in your own beliefs. To get conviction by knowing why your ideas are right while those of others’ are wrong. This can be done by reasoning and data. This will make you decisive.  

Anticipate Challenges and Pre-empt them.  Go to your higher-up with solutions, instead of problems. Make their job easier, learn how they work, and then ride up the ladder.

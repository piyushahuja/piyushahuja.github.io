# Gut Instinct, Not Advice 


# A Vision, Not A Niche

The conventional advice is to pick a niche. The wise thing to do is, before picking a niche,  work back from the eventual state of the world you want to get at. Solve for a niche with the constraints that the solution is scalable to something else.   Tinder picked up a niche: hookups between frats and sororities. But that woule ensure they are not able to scale to, say, OKCupid's niche, whereas the reverse is not true.

Picking a niche is one constraint and solving only for that is one constraint. But you can pick a niche, solving for that, with a view to what you want to eventually become gives you two constraints. 

This is the state of the world we want to get it. If the world were to become like this, so many of the customers who are currently miserable would be happy, and none of the customers who are currently happy would be worse). Then you chart out the path, step by step. Sometimes you only see a step by giving a first step. (Steve Jobs looking at customers - what they won’t, and then working back from that). You need a sociological imagination.

e.g. Paul Graham says FB for Harvard was a qualitative different product from the social network we know of it today. But to get to where it is today, it needed to be a Harvard site first. Growth is the one thing that takes you from here to there. - I disagree. 

You don't need an MVP and you don't need to validate.  You can just think of a startup idea and start: Shaw put Bezos in charge of exploring new business opportunities in the burgeoning world of the Internet. It was while brainstorming ideas in the then-unfamiliar area of electronic commerce that Bezos came to his deceptively simple conclusion: The most logical thing to sell over the Internet was books, largely because two of the country’s largest book distributors already had exhaustive electronic lists.

Do Not Build For A Problem You Yourself Have


*  In 1995 most people weren’t online, and those that were weren’t finding dates there. So Kremen got everyone he knew to sign up for Match. He had all Match employees create profiles, and even though he was in a relationship, he signed up and had his girlfriend sign up, too. There was early success. A critical mass started using the site and online dating in the internet era was born. But it backfired in one important respect. Kremen’s own girlfriend met another man through Match and left him. It was a painful lesson, but at least he knew the site worked.



# A Focal Point

Growth serves as a metric that helps you focus and prioritise (Paul Graham on startups), Rowling on “when you lose eveythitng, you get to know what to focus on, the real value of things”. Similarly, GDP has served as a metric of focus and prioritize (for capitalism). The value of GDP is in its being a substitute metric for "value creation for others”. But in some senses it could be a poor susbtite (in so far as it fails, because of short termism, misuse etc.) If communism is to succeed, we need a similar metric. Maybe communism fails precisely because it fails to provide such a metric to give people focus and direction and guidance and a metric around which to prioritise? Communism needs a metric which espouses its values and morality, just like GDP does for profit. 

# People 

Everything comes down to people. Market is nothing but people coming together. Lay your market. Set your mission. It has to be a noble one, or atlas problem driven one. People would respond. Entrepreneurs working in the same space could help. Investors investing in this problem could help. Have a diverse set of investors, with diverse networks and belonging to different geographies?  Journalists reporting on other people could help.  Don’t think of it as networking. Identify what people are trying to do, and if it kindles your heart, you see the problem they’re trying to solve,  help them with that. 
   

# Fundamental Human Needs 

I used to flirt with girls from all over the world on games.com, via slow dial-up internet, which was not inexpensive. A (girl)friend and I used to sing songs and talk to each other for hours on landline phone, racking up our household phone bill.  Another (girl)friend and I used to play one letter games on SMS. When her balance was 0,  I would recharge her SMS packs. You do not need to create new markets. Technology changes, medium changes, products change, but the fundamental human needs remain the same, and people would pay for getting them met.

# Curiosity, Conviction, Courage 

Act on ideas of others! (combine with Abundance mindset). "Originality” is usually just ignorance of previous ideas. Work in idea space.   Ideas matter.  If lots of other people are not trying something similar to you, your idea is probably a bad idea. And people do steal ideas. Look at Zuckerberg. Look at Rocket Internet. People who have worked in the space for years and know the problems to solve would immediately see a good idea from bad.  Innovation: Requires the ability to differentiate between ideas that seem the same but aren’t. For example: Facebook is a different idea than myspace. Quora is a different idea than yahoo answers. Grasping the salience of these differences is where spotters fail, why investors fail, why ideas are not easy to copy, and why creativity seems so hard when ideas seem in abundance. And why we single out ideas, in hindsight, as the product of genius. Sometimes all genius is = Grasping the salience of difference of ideas + conviction on why it is right and others are wrong + courage to follow it up, and not loosing sight (the latter, called the vision, is extremely hard!)


Curiosity is the root cause of ‘perseverance’. Hackers persevere because what we see as failure, they see as success. Success in having learnt something. Fail fast and learn basically comes down to embracing curiosity. Because once you embrace curiosity, you do not fail even in your failures.

* Fail and restart, or fail and work at company X, is the new way of working. Failure is a value judgement - to a martian, or on an abstract level, you woke up, you did this, did that, went to sleep, repeated the cycle, and just keeled over and died. The old way of working was “rise up, go to work for someone else (be a slave), get paid, keel over and die” All this outrage is unjustified. We have shifted from security and slavery to autonomy and risk, from centralised hierarchies to decentralised flat structures, from suits to hoodies, from passive boredom to active engagement



 
# Derive From Competitors

The conventional advice is that observe behaviour of your active users, and build features which improves that experience, or recruit more users that do that . Don’t worry about competitors 

https://www.quora.com/Why-specifically-did-MySpace-fall-so-fast-and-so-far. 

> Be steady at the wheel. The only way one startup can kill another startup is by getting into the other’s head and leading them off a cliff. If you don’t believe me, try this proof. Are your competitors releasing a bunch of the same features that you have on your roadmap? Yes? Do you know what consumers want*? No? Great, then neither do your competitors. Get back to figuring out what users want! *Hint: If you did, you would already have traction.

But this is precisely what sunk Mysace

> I think the main problem was really that they built their product for their most active users rather than asking themselves which products they needed to build to attract new users and engage inactive users. Facebook on the other hand seem to pay more attention to the popular features of their competitors than the requests of their active users.

Makes you see competitors as allies. Instead of thinking of it as a zero sum game, as competitors eating from your pie, you think of a wealth creation game. Others are attempting to wealth, but are not “getting it”and ending with a bad recipe, and they can help you get it and maybe get the pie (and a good meal) for all. You can also learn from their experience - what worked for them and what didn’t, and prevent you from going down paths - basically draw from the the collective intelligence of the space.  

# Harmony  

What is a good aesthetic? A good aesthetic evokes a feeling of perfect *harmony*. But evoking a feeling of harmony is not just a matter of the visual design, but alo requires other features of your product to play well in synchrony: a perfect user journey, a sensitivity for the customer  (beware of the uncanny valley). A product which doesn't get harmony right is Facebook. When messenger pops up suggesting to initiate a message everytime a friend accepts my request, the idea of harmony is violated.  The whole Design -> UX -> Experience Architect trend is essentiall broadening the role of design to encapsulate the idea of ‘harmony’.

> Aesthetics really matter in the early stage. Spend time and/or money early on nailing a cool logo and beautiful slide template. It really matters. Even copying other beautiful stuff is fine. For getting our first 3/10/100 clients, the fact that we looked and sounded totally pro meant a lot. We seemed like a larger more innovative company because of it. Even for our Series A, the fact that our deck looked world-class helps build the belief. For hiring too it helps. People’s visual senses are easy to recruit to your cause and are powerful influencers. Why not look like you’re already a billion dollar company? I think this is under-optimized for in general even within the YC community. So many cool companies that scream SMALL TIME given their visual sense.

> Conflicting advice exists for a reason. You’re going to get a ton of it. What works for one company, at one stage, won’t work for another company at the same stage. “Don’t overhire” is a great mantra, until you’re bottlenecking scale. Waiting for less dilution makes perfect sense until you’re out of money. Figuring out what’s right for your company (and not being paralyzed by fear of being wrong if it turns out that’s the case) is the knack.

# Do not follow any startup advice. Listen to your gut. 

> It's funny -- these days, I usually recommend that entrepreneurs read LESS. There is just too much out there, it's easy to get lost in other people's opinions and what other people say you need to do. Not only do you end up with less time to DO it, I firmly believe that too much content starts to interfere with our gut instincts. As entrepreneurs, our instincts are our lifeblood! So rule #1: don't let other people's opinions cut you off from your own instinctual knowledge about what is best for your business.

> It helps your brain be able to sort out "that's how Brad is, that's his opinion" from "THIS IS THE ONE AND ONLY TRUTH AND I MUST ABIDE BY IT NOW”


# Don't Pick A Niche. Pick A Vision.  

They say pick a niche. Paul Graham says FB for Harvard was a qualitative different product from the social network we know of it today. But to get to where it is today, it needed to be a Harvard site first. Growth is the one thing that takes you from here to there. - I disagree. The wise thing to do is, before picking a niche,  work back from the eventual state of the world you want to get at. Solve for a niche with the constraints that the solution is scalable to something else.   Tinder picked up a niche: hookups between frats and sororities. But now they are having problems. For a solution, you need constraints. Picking a niche is one constraint and solving only for that is one constraint. But you can pick a niche, solving for that, with a view to what you want to eventually become gives you two constraints. 
This is the state of the world we want to get it. If the world were to become like this, so many of the customers who are currently miserable would be happy, and none of the customers who are currently happy would be worse). Then you chart out the path, step by step. Sometimes you only see a step by giving a first step. (Steve Jobs looking at customers - what they won’t, and then working back from that). You need a sociological imagination - something which tech people usually lack. **Being Mission Driven**

Advice #3: Harmony is underrated. A good sense of design is embedded in the idea of harmony. But harmony also includes getting your user journeys perfect, perfect customer empathy etc. (e.g. uncanny valley). FB doesn’t get harmony write.  the whole Design -> UX -> Experience Architect movement is getting at is ‘harmony’.


# Build Around Fundamental Human Needs. 

That used to chat with strangers on games.com. How my first girlfriend and I used to sing songs and talk to each other on landline phone! Oh, the feeling of seeing that number 565784. Then another crush and me used to play one letter games on SMS. And I would recharge her SMS packs! How technology changes the world around us, and we don’t remember! Memories, and coping up with the face of societal change brought about by technology. 

Advice #5 Courage and conviction is the commodity in short supply, not ideas! But Ideas matter. 

Act on ideas of others! (combine with Abundance mindset). "Originality” is usually just ignorance of previous ideas. Work in idea space.   Ideas matter.  If lots of other people are not trying something similar to you, your idea is probably a bad idea. And people do steal ideas. Look at Zuckerberg. Look at Rocket Internet. People who have worked in the space for years and know the problems to solve would immediately see a good idea from bad.  Innovation: Requires the ability to differentiate between ideas that seem the same but aren’t. For example: Facebook is a different idea than myspace. Quora is a different idea than yahoo answers. Grasping the salience of these differences is where spotters fail, why investors fail, why ideas are not easy to copy, and why creativity seems so hard when ideas seem in abundance. And why we single out ideas, in hindsight, as the product of genius. Sometimes all genius is = Grasping the salience of difference of ideas + conviction on why it is right and others are wrong + courage to follow it up, and not loosing sight (the latter, called the vision, is extremely hard!)





# Everything comes down to people. 

Don’t underestimate people. Everything comes down to people. Market is also nothing but people coming together. Lay your market. Set your mission. It has to be a noble one, or atlas problem driven one. People would respond.   Entrepreneurs working in the same space could help. Investors investing in this problem could help. Have a diverse set of investors, with diverse networks and belonging to different geographies?  Journalists reporting on other people could help.  Don’t think of it as networking. Identify what people are trying to do, and if it kindles your heart, you see the problem they’re trying to solve,  help them with that. 
    * Converse/Cons: ISIS is also mission driven. 

#7: Maybe Do Not Build for a problem you yourself have
    *  In 1995 most people weren’t online, and those that were weren’t finding dates there. So Kremen got everyone he knew to sign up for Match. He had all Match employees create profiles, and even though he was in a relationship, he signed up and had his girlfriend sign up, too. There was early success. A critical mass started using the site and online dating in the internet era was born. But it backfired in one important respect. Kremen’s own girlfriend met another man through Match and left him. It was a painful lesson, but at least he knew the site worked.

# Keep a look at the competitors and Copy them

The traditional advice is that observe behaviour of your active users, and build features which improves that experience, or recruit more users that do that . Don’t worry about competitos https://www.quora.com/Why-specifically-did-MySpace-fall-so-fast-and-so-far. Be steady at the wheel. The only way one startup can kill another startup is by getting into the other’s head and leading them off a cliff. If you don’t believe me, try this proof. Are your competitors releasing a bunch of the same features that you have on your roadmap? Yes? Do you know what consumers want*? No? Great, then neither do your competitors. Get back to figuring out what users want! *Hint: If you did, you would already have traction.

But this is precisely what sunk Mysace
    *  I think the main problem was really that they built their product for their most active users rather than asking themselves which products they needed to build to attract new users and engage inactive users. Facebook on the other hand seem to pay more attention to the popular features of their competitors than the requests of their active users.

Makes you see competitors as allies. Instead of thinking of it as a zero sum game, as competitors eating from your pie, you think of a wealth creation game. Others are attempting to wealth, but are not “getting it”and ending with a bad recipe, and they can help you get it and maybe get the pie (and a good meal) for all. You can also learn from their experience - what worked for them and what didn’t, and prevent you from going down paths - basically draw from the the collective intelligence of the space.  

People underestimate what it takes to do the startup, and overestimate their own ability to do it. Potential entrepreneurs do the opposite. What you need is high hopes, low expectations, and turn yourself into a learning machine with growth mindset.


# You don't need an MVP and you don't need to validate. 

You can just think of a startup idea and start: Shaw put Bezos in charge of exploring new business opportunities in the burgeoning world of the Internet. It was while brainstorming ideas in the then-unfamiliar area of electronic commerce that Bezos came to his deceptively simple conclusion: The most logical thing to sell over the Internet was books, largely because two of the country’s largest book distributors already had exhaustive electronic lists.

# Aesthetics matter. Ugly MVPs wont do.

> Aesthetics really matter in the early stage. Spend time and/or money early on nailing a cool logo and beautiful slide template. It really matters. Even copying other beautiful stuff is fine. For getting our first 3/10/100 clients, the fact that we looked and sounded totally pro meant a lot. We seemed like a larger more innovative company because of it. Even for our Series A, the fact that our deck looked world-class helps build the belief. For hiring too it helps. People’s visual senses are easy to recruit to your cause and are powerful influencers. Why not look like you’re already a billion dollar company? I think this is under-optimized for in general even within the YC community. So many cool companies that scream SMALL TIME given their visual sense.


* If you are meeting investors at an investor day, remember that your goal is not to close–it is to get the next meeting. Investors will seldom choose to commit the first day they hear your pitch, regardless of how brilliant it is. So book lots of meetings. Keep in mind that the hardest part is to get the first money in the company. In other words, meet as many investors as possible but focus on those most likely to close. Always optimize for getting money soonest (in other words, be greedy) vs If you raise convertible debt for a seed round, you should negotiate simple and short documents, close quickly and cheaply, and maintain your options for the Series A.
* Later stage convertible debt can get complicated and adversarial. We know companies that took convertible debt from a corporate investor and couldn’t pay the debt back on time—which triggered the corporate investor’s right to take over the company. Fun stuff. vs However, later on in a company's life convertible debt can make a lot of sense. A few years ago, we had a portfolio company that was planning on an exit in a year to two years and needed one last round of financing to get there. They went out and talked to VCs and figured out how much dilution they would take for a $7mm to $10mm raise. Then they went to Silicon Valley Bank and talked to the venture debt group. In the end, they raised something like $7.5mm of venture debt, issued SVB some Warrants as compensation for making the loan, and built the company for another year, sold it and did much better in the end because they avoided the dilution of the last round. This is an example of where convertible debt is really useful in the financing plan of a startup.


# Curiosity is a virtue. 

 Root cause of ‘perseverance’. Hackers persevere because what we see as failure, they see as success. Success in having learnt something. Fail fast and learn basically comes down to embracing curiosity. Because once you embrace curiosity, you do not fail even in your failures.

    * https://www.quora.com/If-I-want-to-become-an-entrepreneur-where-do-I-start
* Fail and restart, or fail and work at company X, is the new way of working. Failure is a value judgement - to a martian, or on an abstract level, you woke up, you did this, did that, went to sleep, repeated the cycle, and just keeled over and died. The old way of working was “rise up, go to work for someone else (be a slave), get paid, keel over and die” All this outrage is unjustified. We have shifted from security and slavery to autonomy and risk, from centralised hierarchies to decentralised flat structures, from suits to hoodies, from passive boredom to active engagement

# Use A Metric Around Which To Prioritize

Growth serves as a metric that helps you focus and prioritise (Paul Graham on startups), Rowling on “when you lose eveythitng, you get to know what to focus on, the real value of things”. Similarly, GDP has served as a metric of focus and prioritize (for capitalism). The value of GDP is in its being a substitute metric for "value creation for others”. But in some senses it could be a poor susbtite (in so far as it fails, because of short termism, misuse etc.) If communism is to succeed, we need a similar metric. Maybe communism fails precisely because it fails to provide such a metric to give people focus and direction and guidance and a metric around which to prioritise? Communism needs a metric which espouses its values and morality, just like GDP does for profit. 


# Document Your Journey

> When you solve a math problem, especially a hard one, there’s a profound sense of accomplishment accompanied by a need to share your masterpiece with the world. In doing so, most people’s instinct is to present the solution in its most pristine, elegant, nicely worked-out form. This works well to impress, but not so well to teach. After all, your path to discovery almost certainly didn’t land on that clean, elegant solution right away. You stumbled, fumbled and groped in the dark for a while, you tried various things that failed, you hit on the right path only thanks to some instinct or intuition or methodology that makes sense to you but is hard to describe, and so on. All of that stuff is, lamentably, missing from the vast majority of research papers, “solutions to exercises” appendices, and even most worked-out solutions on places like AoPS, where ostensibly the goal is to help people become better problem solvers. On several occasions on Quora, I resisted the urge to present a short, glamorous solution to a problem, and instead revealed in painful detail the false turns, stupid blunders and failed attempts I went through as I was solving it (see here, for example, or here). I like that. I think it’s helpful, I think it’s not done often enough, and I think presenting the most elegant solution can be downright harmful. It makes readers feel it’s magic, and they would have had no chance of discovering it themselves. It can be intimidating and makes math look like voodoo. It’s not. Many things that look like strokes of genius are actually the result of very methodical and organized efforts. So, in the future, I intend to keep doing that as much as I can

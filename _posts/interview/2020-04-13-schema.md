**Relationship Types**

There are three types of relationships between entities:
- 1 to N 
    - `Status` and `Comments` on that status (Facebook)
    - `Resume` and the `Organizations` on that resume (LinkedIn)
    - `Question` and `Answers` on that question (Quora)
    - `User` and `Answers` (Quora)
- N to 1 
    - `Status` and `Author` (Facebook)
    - `Employee` and `Organization`
    - `Question` and `User` (Quora)

  or reverse of 1 to N

    - `Comments` and `Status` that it belongs to (Facebook)
    -  `Organizations` and `Resume` that refer it (LinkedIn)
    - `Answer` and `Question` that it belongs to (Quora)
    - `Answer` and `User`  (Quora)

- N to N 
    + `Status` and `Tags` (Instagram)
    + `Users` and `Organizations` (Linkedin)

# Normalization


The normalization rules are designed to **enhances the integrity of the data** at some possible **performance cost for certain retrieval applications** (data which may have been retrievable from one record in an unnormalized design may have to be retrieved from several records in the normalized form). It is biased toward the assumption that all non-key fields will be updated frequently. It prevents update anomalies (easy to change entries without going through all records) and data inconsistencies (less mistakes) and minimizes redundancy (efficient user of space). Removing duplication is the key to normalisation .   There is no obligation to fully normalize all records when actual performance requirements are taken into account: so it depends what your data access patterns are going to be. It also makes sharding difficult. 

A NoSQL record does not adhere to first normal form (variable number of fields), but we can still ask whether to extract individual fields into their own separate collection or not. 

----


**How to find if it can be normalized?**

You can "smell" duplication, scope for inconsistencies and update mistakes by asking: Is non-key field a fact about a subset of a key or another non-key field?

> The key, the whole key, and nothing but the key

If that happens, these properties are present in your (tables/collection) for some dependent non-key field:

- **Duplication** The dependent non-key field is repeated in the record of every key which has the primary non-key.
- **Write Overhead** If the primary non-key changes, every such record must be updated (if department address changes, all entries must be changed). We would need to do extra work in ensuring consistency on every write (e.g. we would need to ensure that the added question/status has the same author name as the name in the `User` field and as other questions by them) 
- **Scope for Inconsistency** Because of the redundancy, the data might become inconsistent, with different records showing different dependent non-key for the primary non-key (different address for the same deparment for different employees). There would be no single source of truth (e.g the name of the author might be present in both a `Question` table and the `User` table )
- **No Orphaning and Evolvability** If at some point in time there are no primary non-keys, there may be no record in which to keep the dependent non-key (orphaned tags, lost department address etc.)


 ----

**Which entities or fields to normalize?**
> Normalize until it hurts, denormalize until it works. (I.e. prefer normal forms but denormal will have better performance.)

You keep it denormalized if the relationship will remain 1-to-N, the field/key does not support a unique representation of its values (such as free text input), the access patters are same across the entire record, the field is not needed in isolation and is not likely to evolve into a more complex entity. Examples include a `Status` and `Comments`, `User` and `Location`. This is true even if it is a Table or a Collection.  

You normalize if the relationship is N-1 (2 table) or N-N (3 tables), a single source of truth or unique representation is desirable, the access patterns are different, the field is queried in isolation and is likely to evolve into an indepndent entity with its own attributes. 


1. **What is the Relationship? 1-N, N-1, N-N** 1-N relationships are well represented as embedded.  N-1 and N-N relationships, if embedded would result in denormalization and all its warts. The 1-to-N relationshop is a tree-like structure. Typically the entire tree is loaded as part of the queries. If all the data you need for one key is all in one "place", if you know that that will always be your primary access pattern, then you don't need joins and nosql systems may be faster for you. If you need joins, no sql systems not suitable as it would be slower (Multiple roundtrip queries to the db) and lead to more complex code (Emulate the joins in application) Example Queries for 1-to-N:
> `Get all comments corresponding to a given status` ("get all status corresponding to a particular comment" doesn't even make sense)
> 
> `Get all answers corresponding to a question` ("get all questions corresponding to an answer" doesn't make sense either)
  

2.  Is the data likely to become more interconnected? The data always tends to become more interconnected (move towards N-to-N) as application complexity increases. For example, if Linkedin originally did not have recognize an entity for `Organization` which different users could map to, then it would be 1-to-N, but over time, it might decide to include that, in which case the relationship would become N-to-N. We can still store the relationship in a denormalized form (e.g. store author name in every status, or array of tags within status), as in the case of a 1-to-N relationship. This would avoid joins. (However, this causes duplication and will require extra work at the time of writing to ensure that data is consistent as noted)

3. **User interface: free text input or options?**  Free text suggests keeping it embedded/denormalized.  Functional dependencies only exist when the things involved have unique and singular identifiers (representations) (not having them lead to data maintenance problems of their own.) functional dependencies and the various normal forms are really only defined for situations in which there are unique and singular identifiers. If two representations of address: 123 Main St., New York or 123 Main Street, NYC, then address does not have a functional dependency. 

4. **Static vs Dynamic Updates**: Are some entries higher write frequency?
5. **Important as a standalone entity which can evolve?** (e.g. orphaned tags, warehouse addresses)?
6. **Do we need to analyze the data of the fields in isolation of its main document?** then we should make it in a separate entity. 
  > "get all statuses posted today" (for feed): so extract Status from User
  
  > "get all comments posted today": doesn't make sense so keep comments as part of Status

**2 Table with Foreign Keys  vs 3 Table Collection with Mapping Tablen**


- Normalize with a second table 

Option 1: store the foreign key (e.g store author name) in one of the tables (one knows about another). Many to one is well represented.  
 

Option 2: Foreign keys in both table  (both know about each other). 

However, arrays of foreign id in the case of many-to-many makes it difficult to query or join, so not desirable. 

- No Reference but a separate mapping table (Both don't know about each other).  To populate queries, "give all tags of a particular status" or "give all statuses of a particular tag", we would need to emulate two joins.

# Case Study: Implementing Tags


> A tag is a keyword or label that categorizes your question with other, similar questions. Using the right tags makes it easier for others to find and answer your question.

There are three major database queries which you will do: 
- Output all Tags for one Item
- Draw a Tag-Cloud
- Select all items for one Tag Title.

Hierarchal "tags" or categories in the TagTable: This is commonly needed on sites that have categories and subcategories but need the flexibility of tagging. For example, recipe sites, auto parts sites, business directories, etc. These types of data don't usually fit into only one single category so tagging is the answer but you need to use something like the Nested Set Model or the Adjacency List Model in your Tag table.

Possible Rules triggered by the tagging API:

- “use the formal company name that appears on their annual SEC filings”
- “search the tags database before creating a new tag” 

----

**1-Table Implementation**

**PostTable**

```
Id
Content
Tags: [tag1, tag2, tag2]
```

Example Query: *Select all posts with a particular union of tags*

```
SELECT - 
FROM `PostTable` 
WHERE tags LIKE "%search%" 
OR tags LIKE "%webservice%" 
OR tags LIKE "%semweb%"
```

**Drawbacks**

- Partial Text search in EVERY document harder?
- Cannot store many tags as limit on Tags field
- Cannot store Tag metadata, description, hierarchy
- The document size will become very large.
  - If I load this user object via REST service in my mobile app it could take a while.  
  - Furthermore in worst case the user document could exceed the MongoDb 16MB document limit.

----

**2-Table Implementation: PostTable and TagTable. Relationship Embedded as Foreign Keys.** 

**PostTable**

```
PostId
Content
Tags: [tagId1, tagId2, tagId3]
```


**TagTable**

```
TagId
TagName
```

**The Good**

More normalised, as repeated tags have one document
Can Store tag metadata, hierarchy etc.

**The Bad**

- Cannot store relationship metadata
- Search?: queries of type show all posts with tagName = xxxx require iterating through the array and joining?

-----

**2-Table Implementation: PostTable +  Mapping Table**


**PostTable**

```
PostId
Content
```

**PostTagTable**

```
PostId
TagName
```


**The Bad**

- Not Normalised (Duplicate Tag Names), so takes more Space in DB
- Slower queries: the query for the tag title is much faster in a small table which contains each tag only once and this certainly is true. 
  - But taking in regard the savings for not having to join and the fact that you can build a good index on them could easily compensate for this.
- Not normalised, so extra work needed to remain consistent
  + The inconsistency argument is a little moot Tags are free text fields and there is no expected operation like 'rename all tags "foo" to "bar"
- You cannot create "unused”/orphan tags so an "add tag" feature has to be performed on an Item. (On the other implementations, the "add tag" feature can be performed independently 




*Example Query: Select all posts with a particular tag* (Only 2-table join if we have tagName)



```
SELECT *
FROM PostTable
JOIN PostTagTable ON PostId
WHERE TagName = 
```
or[^difference]

[^difference]: There is no difference between the two. For larger queries the first way is more readable. If you have a mix left joins and some inner joins, then it is far more consistent to have the joins condition on the join clause, rather than some in the joins and some in the where clause.  Second representation makes query more readable and makes it look very clear as to which join corresponds to which condition.  

```
SELECT *
FROM PostTable, PostTagTable
WHERE PostTable.Id =  PostTagTable.postID
and tagName = :tag
```

Example Query: *Select all posts with a particular union of tags*

```
SELECT b.*
FROM scBookmarks b, scCategories c
WHERE c.bId = b.bId
AND (c.category IN ('bookmark', 'webservice', 'semweb'))
GROUP BY b.bId
```

----


**3-Table Implementation: Post Table +  Mapping Table**

**PostTable**

```
PostId
Content
```

**TagTable**

```
TagId
TagName
```


**PostTagTable**

```
PostId
TagId
```


Example Query: *Items for one tag*(3 table joing if we have tag name)

```
SELECT Item.* 
  FROM Item
  JOIN ItemTag ON Item.ItemID = ItemTag.ItemID
  JOIN Tag ON ItemTag.TagID = Tag.TagID
 WHERE Tag.Title = :title
```

Example Query: *Tag-Cloud* (2 table join)

```
SELECT Tag.Title, count(*)
  FROM Tag
  JOIN ItemTag ON Tag.TagID = ItemTag.TagID
 GROUP BY Tag.Title
```

Example Query: *All Tags for one ite*m (2 table join if we have id):

```
Select tagName
FROM Tag
JOIN ItemTag on Tag.tagID = ItemTag.TagID
Where ItemTag.ItemID = :id
```

**The Bad**

- Complex Queries. In the three-table solution for insert and update of item you have to lookup the Tag table to see if there are already entries. Then you have to join them with new ones. This is no trivial task.


-----


**1-Table Implementation**


If you are using a database that supports map-reduce, like couchdb, storing tags in a plain text field or list field is indeed the best way. Example:

```
tagcloud: {
  map: function(doc){ 
    for(tag in doc.tags){ 
      emit(doc.tags[tag],1) 
    }
  }
  reduce: function(keys,values){
    return values.length
  }
}
```

**TagTable** (29488 rows)

```
tagId
Tagname
```

**TagSynonymTable** (1916 rows)

A synonym tag can only be a synonym for one master tag. A master tag can have multiple synonym tags:

```
sourceTag: tag1
masterTag: tag3

sourceTag: tag2
masterTag: tag3

sourceTag: tag4
masterTag: tag3 
```

A master tag also be a synonym tag.

```
sourceTag: tag3
masterTag: tag5
```


Q: Why no foreign key on master tag?  

A: Foreign keys help by quickly searching based on id, but here we only search or make joins based on tag names. Only if you have an information requirement that can't be achieved due to the current technical implementation there would be reason to change or add foreign-keys and possible indexes. 



Hierarchy (Directional Graph without circular dependencies.  technical processes in place to prevent circular references from happening).


Big Master Tag

Master Tag ... Master tag 2

**Normalize vs Denormalization (Redudancy) in NOSql**


When you use an Id, the info that is meaningful to humans is stord in only one place. Because it has no meaning to humans, it never needs to change, even if the information that it identifies changes. (otherwise all the redudant copies need to be changed: write overheads, inconsistencies). 

The developer has to decide whether to denormalize or manually resolve references from one record to another (in the application code) 

Advantages of normalizing (converting to many-to-one relationship)

* Consistent style and spelling across docs
* avoiding ambiguity if there are serveral values with the same name
* easy of updating: Stored in only one place
* internationalization support: change to local language at will
* better search: a separate tag table can encode synonyms, misspellings, and the tagId an be linked

Look at this script and the costs of normalization in nosql databases. Here we are storing an array of tagsid and skillsid in the superpower entity. 
To ensure consistency, we have to write to both the tables on every write to the superpower table.
To obtain the ids of new tags/skills, we have to emulate a join in application code (look at the code which populates and then filters id).
All of this increases the code complecity.

Instead, had we kept tags and skills in denormalized form within the supowerpower entity, we do not need to write or emulate joins. The problem is that we would not be able to keep skills as an independent evolvable entity and link them to the superpowers. 

```javascript

let updateSuperpower = (req, res) => {
  (async () => {
    let response = {};
    let tags =  req.body.tags || [];
    let skills = req.body.skills || [];
    // Returns an array of tag documents. 

    await Promise.all([powerHelper.saveTags({tags: tags}), skillHelper.saveSkills({skills: skills})]).then((results) => {
        tags = results[0];
        skills = results[1];
      }).catch((error) => {console.log("Error: " + error)})
    let tagIds = [];
    tags.filter((tag) => {
      tagIds.push(tag._id);
    });
        
    let skillIds = [];
    skills.filter((skill) => {
      skillIds.push(skill._id);
    });

    await powerHelper.updateSuperpower({superpowerId: req.body.superpowerId, description:req.body.description, tagIds:tagIds, skillIds: skillIds});
    return response;
  })().then(function (response){
        utils.sendSuccess(res, "Success", response);
    }).catch(function (error){
        utils.sendError(res, 400, "Failed");
    });
}
```

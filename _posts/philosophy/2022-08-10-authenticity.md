* Is your authentic self something you were born with and you need to fulfill, or is it something you create for yourself throughout your life?
* Does your obligation to be true to yourself override your obligations to others?
* Where does authenticity end and narcissism start?



Aristotle: One of which in which you fail to be authentic is when you dont act on your own assessment, but to please others.

What lies behind doing the right thing? 
* A virtuous person does things for their own sake, not for some ulterior motive to please others.

Are you the author, or origin, of your actions? Or is it driven by the opinion of others or what you want from others?

Acting on your behalf or judging your actions through the eyes of others?

Augustine: One of the others is God? Do you do this because you think that action is right, or because you are afraid God will punish you otherwise? (Pure fear vs Servile fear) True Christian faces pure/chaste fear - they love what God loves (not doing because they are scared of God/scared of punishment)

Rousseau 18th Century: Natural drive to preserve ourselves AND drive for compassion. Social existence corrupts human beings so that our natural drive for compassion is overriden by other drives like "what others think of us".

Distrust of reason and rationality. We are more authentic when we are more in touch with our passionate side. Reason is used us to divert us from our true nature.

Kierkegard 19th Century (Protestant): Social existence was by and large a negative thing, encouraged conformity. It was for the individual to stand out from the crowd. Angst: 

Fear (emotion we may feel in relation to a particular worry/concern/danger) vs Anxiety (existential).

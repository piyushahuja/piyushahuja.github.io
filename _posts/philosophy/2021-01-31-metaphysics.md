[There is no escaping metaphysics](https://iai.tv/articles/auid-2236-there-is-no-escaping-metaphysics-auid-2236?_auid=2020)


Terms: 
* Realism (Platonic: universals before things, Aristotle: universals in things, universals are real entities, they exist distinctly, apart from the particulars that instantiate them, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.)
* Anti-realism
* Idealism
* Materialism
* Dualism
* Nominalism (universals do not exist. we predicate the same property of/to multiple entities, but argues that the entities only share a name and do not have a real quality in common.)
* Conceptualism (universals exist as concepts within the mind)
* Phenominalism
* Naturalism


* Essence vs Accident
* Necessary vs Contingent
* Abstract vs Concrete
* Real vs Ideal
* Internal vs External
* Analytic vs Synthetic
* Sense and Reference

Experiments:

* Mary's Room (Jackson)
* What is it like to be a bat?
* China Brain
* Twin Earth (Putnam)
* Chinese Room (Searle)
* Philosophical Zombie

# Existence

Which of these exist? 

* Material Objects (Stone, Tree)
* Universals
* Theoretrical Entities of Science (Electrons, Genes)
* Laws of Nature
* Mathematical Entities (Triangles, Numbers)
* Mental States
* Moral Facts, Objective Moral Values
* Fiction (Unicorn, Dragon, Sherlock Holmes)
* God
* Past, Future
* Events, Processess
* Collective Fictions (Government, Nations)

Linguistic analysis:  truth value of statements about existence depends on the theory of truth

Theories of Truth:

* Correspondence: truth consists in correspondence to the facts
* Coherence: truth consists in coherence with a set of beliefs or propositions 
* Deflationary: According to the deflationist, however, such suggestions are mistaken, and, moreover, they all share a common mistake. The common mistake is to assume that truth has a nature of the kind that philosophers might find out about and develop theories of. For the deflationist, truth has no nature beyond what is captured in ordinary claims such as that ‘snow is white’ is true just in case snow is white. Philosophers looking for the nature of truth are bound to be frustrated, the deflationist says, because they are looking for something that isn't there.

# Universals and Properties

**Should the properties an object has in common with other objects, such as color and shape, be considered to exist beyond those objects? And if a property exists separately from objects, what is the nature of that existence?**


Universals are qualities or relations found in two or more entities. As an example, if all cup holders are circular in some way, circularity may be considered a universal property of cup holders. Further, if two daughters can be considered female offspring of Frank, the qualities of being female, offspring, and of Frank, are universal properties of the two daughters. Many properties can be universal: being human, red, male or female, liquid or solid, big or small, etc.

Philosophers agree that human beings can talk and think about universals, but disagree on whether universals exist in reality beyond mere thought and speech.

The problem of universals is specifically accounting for the fact that some things are of the same type. For example, Fluffy and Kitzler are both cats, or, the fact that certain properties are repeatable, such as: the grass, the shirt, and Kermit the Frog are green. 

One wants to know by virtue of what are Fluffy and Kitzler both cats, and what makes the grass, the shirt, and Kermit green?

* Platonist argument: universals are required for certain general words to have meaning and for the sentences in which they occur to be true or false. Take the sentence "Djivan Gasparyan is a musician" for instance. The realist may claim that this sentence is only meaningful and expresses a truth because there is an individual, Djivan Gasparyan, who possesses a certain quality: musicianship. Therefore, it is assumed that the property is a universal which is distinct from the particular individual who has the property.
The Platonist answer is that all the green things are green in virtue of the existence of a universal: a single abstract thing that, in this case, is a part of all the green things. With respect to the color of the grass, the shirt and Kermit, one of their parts is identical. In this respect, the three parts are literally one. Greenness is repeatable because there is one thing that manifests itself wherever there are green things.
Plato famously held, on one interpretation, that there is a realm of abstract forms or universals apart from the physical world (see theory of the forms). Particular physical objects merely exemplify or instantiate the universal. 
    * But where do they exist?  
        * One possibility is that it is outside space and time.  
            * However, naturalists assert that nothing is outside of space and time.
        * Precisely because some form is immanent in several physical objects, it must also transcend each of those physical objects; in this way, the forms are "transcendent" only insofar as they are "immanent" in many physical objects. In other words, immanence implies transcendence; they are not opposed to one another. In this view, there would there not be a separate "world" or "realm" of forms that is distinct from the physical world, thus shirking much of the worry about where to locate a "universal realm". Moderate realists hold that there is no realm in which universals exist, but rather universals are located in space and time wherever they are manifest. Now, recall that a universal, like greenness, is supposed to be a single thing. 
            * But isnt it strange that there could be a single thing that exists in multiple places simultaneously? The realist maintains that all the instances of greenness are held together by the exemplification relation, but this relation cannot be explained.
        * (Bleh) Some Neoplatonists, such as the pagan philosopher Plotinus and the Christian philosopher Augustine, imply (anticipating conceptualism) that universals are contained within the mind of God.

Nominalism arose in reaction to this problem. It denies 
the existence of universals.

* Fluffy and Kitzler, for example, are both cats simply because the predicate 'is a cat' applies to both of them. And this is the case for all similarity of attribute among objects. The main criticism of this view is that it does not provide a sufficient solution to the problem of universals. It fails to provide an account of what makes it the case that a group of things warrant having the same predicate applied to them.

* 'Cat' applies to both cats because Fluffy and Kitzler resemble an exemplar cat closely enough to be classed together with it as members of its kind, or that they differ from each other (and other cats) quite less than they differ from other things, and this warrants classing them together. 
    * Some resemblance nominalists will concede that the resemblance relation is itself a universal, but is the only universal necessary. Others argue that each resemblance relation is a particular

* Conceptualists hold a position intermediate between nominalism and realism, saying that universals exist only within the mind and have no external or substantial reality. Conceptualism is a philosophical theory that explains universality of particulars as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind. The conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of universals from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside of the mind's perception of them.


**Metaphysical Realism and Anti-Realism**

The basic idea of realism is that the kinds of thing which exist, and what they are like, are independent of us and the way in which we find out about them; antirealism denies this. Most people find it natural to be realists with respect to physical facts: how many planets there are in the solar system does not depend on how many we think there are, or would like there to be, or how we investigate them; likewise, whether electrons exist or not depends on the facts, not on which theory we favour. However, it seems natural to be antirealist about humour: something’s being funny is very much a matter of whether we find it funny, and the idea that something might really be funny even though nobody ever felt any inclination to laugh at it seems barely comprehensible. The saying that ‘beauty is in the eye of the beholder’ is a popular expression of antirealism in aesthetics. An obviously controversial example is that of moral values; some maintain that they are real (or ‘objective’), others that they have no existence apart from human feelings and attitudes.

Frege's semantic realism (for Dummett, the only sense in which we can investigate realism) can be defined “as the belief that statement of disputed class, undecidable sentences, possess an objective truth-value, independently of our means of knowing it: they are true or false in virtue of a reality exciting independently of us.  Our sentential understanding consists in our knowledge of sentences’ truth conditions, where truth is treated as potentially evidence-transcendent or
epistemically unconstrained. 

Michael Dummett’s proposal that realism and antirealism (the latter term being his own coinage) were more productively understood in terms of two opposed theories of meaning. Thus, a realist is one who would have us understand the meanings of sentences in terms of their truth-conditions (the situations that must obtain if they are to be true); an antirealist holds that those meanings are to be understood by reference to assertability-conditions (the circumstances under which we would be justified in asserting them).

For Dummett, realism is best understood as semantic realism, i.e., as the view accepting that every declarative sentence in one's language is bivalent (determinately true or false) and evidence-transcendent (independent of our means of coming to know which), while anti-realism rejects this view in favour of a concept of knowable (or assertible) truth. Historically, these debates had been understood as disagreements about whether a certain type of entity objectively exists or not. Thus we may speak of (anti-)realism with respect to other minds, the past, the future, universals, mathematical entities (such as natural numbers), moral categories, the material world, or even thought. 


Dummett's Challenge: 

Realist have a belief that truth-conditions can be considered as evidence-transcendent.

Challenges to realism:

* Manifestation Challenge: "a speaker's grasp of the meaning of a declarative, indexical-free sentence must be manifested in her uses of that sentence" expresses a behaviorist and reductive theory of meaning. Knowledge of meaning of a sentence has to manifest in linguistic behavior, essentially in agreement with Quine's view of language.
When one utters a sentence about the world, there is no evidence of any link between what one says and the actual state of affairs. It could entirely be possible that the use of a sentence and its truth value is determined by the speaker according to prior linguistic practice, not according to the meaning of a sentence in the sense of correspondence with facts. 

*  If realism were true, competence in one’s language would be impossible to acquire. "Socrates sneezed in his sleep the night before he took the hemlock." Understanding meaning of this sentence is equivalent to (i) understanding what conditions or state of affairs that would make this sentence true or false (Frege) OR (ii) understanding how to appripriately use this sentence in a linguistic community (later Wittgenstein). Semantic Realists say this sentence is either true of false. This requires that the meantal representations of a sentence (its meaning) are linked to its truth conditions. Anyone learning a sentence would have to grasp the correspondence between its meaning and the state of affairs that makes its true.

**Is existence a property of individuals? If yes, are there individuals that lack it?**


Useful abstractions to dissect this question: 

* The relationship between an individual’s essence (being) and its existence

A thing’s essential properties are inseparable from the bearer, not only in the sense that the property is necessarily had by that object (insofar as that object were to exist), but in the deeper sense that any adequate account of what that object is involves that property; they are part of any adequate definition of the thing or answer to the question ‘What is it?’. e.g. I am essentially a human and perhaps essentially the person I in fact am, if there are individual essences in addition to general essences.

* The distinction between accident and essence and that distinction’s relation to contingency and necessity. 

All essences are necessary and all contingent properties are accidents (not necessary). But there is no strict one-to-one correspondence: there could be necessary properties which are not essential: I am necessarily identical to something and necessarily such that 2+2=4, but these properties are among my accidents, as they are not part of any adequate account of what I am and what distinguishes me from others. 




**Position: No, existence is not a property.**

Argument 1 (Aristotle): Nothing more to existence than essence: "there is not a space between an articulation of what a thing is and that thing’s existing" 

Argument 2 (Hume) There is no impression of existence distinct from the impression of an object, which is ultimately on Hume’s view a bundle of qualities. As all of our contentful ideas derive from impressions 

Argument 3 (Kant) Proponents of the ontological argument argue that the concept of God as an entity with all perfections or a being of which no greater can be conceived entails God’s existence, as existence is a perfection and a being that exists is greater than a being that does not exist. Kant objected that existence is not a property: "Thus when I think a thing, through whichever and however many predicates I like (even in its thoroughgoing determination), not the least bit gets added to the thing when I posit in addition that this thing is. For otherwise what would exist would not be the same as what I had thought in my concept, but more than that, and I could not say that the very object of my concept exists”

Argument 4 (Frege, Russell):  existence is not a property of individuals but instead a second-order property: a property of concepts (Frege). second-order property of propositional functions, to say that dinosaurs do not exist is to say that the property of being a dinosaur is not instantiated; to say that Jean-Baptiste Botul does not exist is to say that some property—say, the property of being a unique post-war critic of Kant and father of Butolism—is not instantiated. In neither case is it to say of some individual that it does not exist, which neither Frege nor Russell thought made sense. The view that existence is not a property of individuals became the common view in the early 20th Century. the thought, developed most forcefully by Russell, that denying that existence is a first-order property is the only way to avoid the consequence that there are things that do not exist and thus that there is a distinction between being and existing, our second framing question from above. 

**Position: Yes, existence is a property. There are things which do not exist.**

Argument: One can have an understanding of what a man or a phoenix is without knowing whether it exists. So, existence is something in addition to essence. Existence is not part of most objects’s natures and so those objects can be conceived or thought of separately from their existing. (Aquinas)


Existence is a genuine property of individuals but not universally had (Meinong)
* primary motivation is the puzzle of negative singular existentials—sentences that seem to truly assert the nonexistence of an individual, such as the sentence ‘Jean-Baptiste Botul does not exist’. In order to be true, it seems, the subject position must designate some entity of which nonexistence is truly predicated, in which case there are things—the designation of these singular terms—that do not exist. Frege and Russell, by contrast, take the same sentences to demonstrate that those expressions are not genuine singular terms at all and that negative existentials all have a general form, asserting the noninstantiation of a property.

Absolutely everything exists. 

A sentence like ‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ either expresses a fully articulate singular proposition and so is false, as in that case there is a referent of the subject-place singular term which exists, or does not express a truth evaluative proposition at all, as the singular term lacks a semantic content. In neither case is the sentence true. Avoiding that consequence was a primary motivation behind all of the alternative accounts discussed in the previous two sections.
    +  The first challenge facing a proponent of such a view, then, is to explain how sentences like ‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ are both meaningful and sometimes apparently true without abandoning the theses that absolutely everything exists and that all names are devices of direct reference.

+  Kripe: ‘Ronald McDonald’ refer to existent, albeit abstract, fictional characters. Fictional characters have both being and existence. On this view, then, there are no genuinely true singular negative existentials. what a speaker means when she utters the sentence ‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ is not the false proposition that that sentence expresses but instead the true proposition that (the fictional character) Ronald McDonald is not a real person or is not concrete. Indeed, this is suggested by the natural amendment, ‘‘Ronald McDonald does not exist; he’s a creation of advertisement!’’ 

All meaningful singular existentials are true and their negations false. We mistakenly take some singular negative existentials to be true because we conflate or do not sharply distinguish existing from being concrete. The benefit of this account is the simple semantics of proper names and the sparse metaphysics. The cost is revisionism regarding what we mean when we use apparently true singular negative existentials.

Internal vs external ontological questions.
Quine view of ontology.

* The notion of 'one reality' behind our everyday perceptions is common in everyday life, and some find it unsettling that what 'exists' might be a matter of what language one chooses to use.
    * Putnam points out that while the pages of a book are regarded as part of book when they are attached, they are things-in-themselves if they are detached. My nose is only part of an object, my person. On the other hand, is my nose the same as the collection of atoms or molecules forming it? This arbitrariness of language is called conceptual relativity, a matter of conventions.[13] The point is made that if one wishes to refer only to 'pages', then books may not exist, and vice versa if one wishes to admit only to books. Thus, in this view, the Carnapian multiplicity of possible linguistic frameworks proposes a variety of 'realities' and the prospect of choosing between them, a form of what is called ontological pluralism, or multiple realities.

# The Mind Body Problem


Monism: There is only one substance

- Idealism: everything is mind. Physical stuff can be reduced to mental stuff (i.e. physicality is an illusion). (George Berkeley)
- Physicalism: everything is physical stuff (which includes energy, electrons/photons, waves, forces etc.) Mental states can be 'reduced to it'. 
    - Folk psychology will be erased with the progress of science. Most mental states dont even exist. (Churchlands eliminative materialsm).Proponents of these views argue that in the same way that talk of demonic possession was questioned with scientific advance, categorisations like "pain" may need to be revised. debates over the reality of a psychological concept like "demonology" – the posit that evil spirits influence human behaviour. An eliminativist might argue that this theory completely fails to describe anything real; the reductionist might argue that the concepts are valid, and that science will simply provide an increasingly detailed understanding of the demons. The revisionist would be somewhere in between, suggesting only that partial revision of the common sense understanding will be necessary. That is, parts of the demon theory will be validated by future research. Today, one is likely to be eliminativist about demons. However, eliminative materialists mention other psychological concepts (e.g. belief, will, consciousness) about which one is more likely to be revisionist.
    - Behaviorism: inner mental phenomenon do not exist. Like functionalism but without inner states, only input and output. 
    - type identity theory:  mental events can be grouped into types, and can then be correlated with types of physical events in the brain. For example, one type of mental event, such as "mental pains" will, presumably, turn out to be describing one type of physical event (like C-fiber firings). contrasted by token identity physicalism, which argues that mental events are unlikely to have "steady" or categorical biological correlates. These positions make use of the philosophical type–token distinction (e.g., Two persons having the same "type" of car need not mean that they share a "token", a single vehicle). Type physicalism can now be understood to argue that there is an identity between types (any mental type is identical with some physical type), whereas token identity physicalism says that every token mental state/event/property is identical to some brain state/event/property.
    - anomalous monism (Donald Davidson): like reductive physicalism however anomalous becase unlike physical stuff this cannot be predicted or explained by physical laws. Since (in this theory) every mental event is some physical event or other, the idea is that someone's thinking at a certain time, for example, that snow is white, is a certain pattern of neural firing in their brain at that time, an event which can be characterized as both a thinking that snow is white (a type of mental event) and a pattern of neural firing (a type of physical event). There is just one event that can be characterized both in mental terms and in physical terms. If mental events are physical events, they can at least in principle be explained and predicted, like all physical events, on the basis of laws of physical science. However, according to anomalous monism, events cannot be so explained or predicted as described in mental terms (such as "thinking", "desiring" etc.), but only as described in physical terms: this is the distinctive feature of the thesis as a brand of physical monism.
- Panpsychism: everything is one consciousness
- Neutral monism: there is an unknown substance (e.g. God), which gives rise to appearance of physical and mental properties
    + How is this different from dual aspect monism? or Property dualism?

Dualism:



- Substance dualism (Descartes): There are two distinct substances: mind and body   
    + Causation: How does one cause events in another??
        + Only physical events causes physical events. That mental events cause physical events is an illusion (Epiphenomalism: Dennett, Huxley)
        + Physical events causes mental events. But its not necessary: non-physical stuff can also cause it (Searle)
        + There are laws governing how physical stuff interacts with the mental world. But they havn't been discoevered yet (Chalmers, Nagel)


In between:

Functionalism: mental states (beliefs, desires, being in pain, etc.) are constituted solely by their functional role, which means, their causal relations with other mental states, sensory inputs and behavioral outputs.
a theoretical level between the physical implementation and behavioral output. Since mental states are identified by a functional role, they are said to be realized on multiple levels; in other words, they are able to be manifested in various systems, even perhaps computers, so long as the system performs the appropriate functions. While a computer's program performs the functions via computations on inputs to give outputs, implemented via its electronic substrate, a brain performs the functions via its biological operation and stimulus responses.
  - The main difference between Logical behaviorism and Functionalism is that Functionalism emphasizes on the importance of pre-existing conditions. For example in Logical Behaviorism ‘Pizza desire’ for person X would be X’s actual and dispositional behaviors concerning pizza. However, If, for example, X was presented with pizza and X does not eat it, then according to LB, X does not have pizza desire. On the other hand, Functionalism would say it would depend on pre-existing conditions. For instance, X might have a pizza desire, but has a pre-existing belief that the pizza is just a hologram or made of plastic for display.
        - Other than the difference that states that Functionalism emphasizes on the importance of pre-existing conditions (or current mental state) while L.Behaviorism does not, is that Causal-role functionalism identify mental states as internal states that causes behaviors and caused by some environmental causes. Such functionalists believe that: For any mental state M, M is the internal state that causally mediates in the right way between environmental input, behavioral output, and other mental states.
        - Adding the mental events is a big change. Functionalism does not seek to reduce mental states merely to inputs and outputs; part of what it is to be a pain is to cause the desire to alleviate the pain.
        - Further, functionalism allows for a mentalistic psychology. Functionalism in the philosophy of mind is tied towards the idea in computer science of distinguishing the software being run from the hardware running it. Cognitive science has taken this distinction of explanatory levels and run with it, all thanks to the philosophical foundation provided by neuroscience. Never again will we be called unscientific for invoking mental states!
        - On this understanding, type physicalism can be seen as incompatible with functionalism, since it claims that what characterizes mental states (e.g. pain) is that they are physical in nature, while functionalism says that what characterizes pain is its functional/causal role and its relationship with yelling "ouch", etc. However, any weaker sort of physicalism which makes the simple ontological claim that everything that exists is made up of physical matter is perfectly compatible with functionalism. Moreover, most functionalists who are physicalists require that the properties that are quantified over in functional definitions be physical properties. Hence, they are physicalists, even though the general thesis of functionalism itself does not commit them to being so.

plato: chariot matephor
aristotle: soul has three parts: growth/nutrition shared with plants, perception shared with animals and reason which is unique to human beings. Things have a Form and function, Purposive and intelligent

materialism: pre-socratic philosophers, epicurus, galileo (who wanted to focus on size, shape, color, measurable quantifiable things as being explanations for things which are qualitative (taste, feelings, etc.) , descartes (who defended galileo by compatmentalizing mind/soul as a separate domain, and emphasized maths + observation as a basis for knowing the empirical world - radical idea at time (why should math tell you anything?))

christian church: attack against eternal truths (and the soul which is in contact with it)

william blake (not christian): leaves out so much: beauty, imagination etc.

kant: reconciling materialism with moral experience, in particular free will. 

diderot: mind is a hapsichord which plays itsef, a book which writes on itself

churchlands: we can completely replace psychological language by materialist language. 
against: our rich vocabulatory helps us in explaining behavior, predictiong what others would do etc. it cannot be replaced.

Epiphemenalism: if you really introspect, most of the things we do are automatic

challenge: top-down causation, as the mind and will causing things in the physical world (as opposed to epiphenomentalism)



# Time

**Is it absurd to suppose that only the present exists?** 

*  To say that only present exists, is that the only thing in our world is there here and now, and any talk about the past or the future is much like a fictional talk, which has its referent as something which doesn’t exist.

* McTaggart's proof about hte unreality of time: When McTaggart says ''Time involves change'', it seems like a sleight of hand. What does it mean? Time is the dimension of change. But that doesn't make anything clearer.
We observe time through A series and B series, or we observe the dimension of change through A series and B series.

* Does tense indicate a feature of the world? Do tensed statements have tenseless truth conditions? Would that show that tense is unreal?

* Can later events affect earlier events? Is Time Travel possible?

# Persistence Through Time

**Material objects extend through space by having different spatial parts in different places. But how do they persist through time? According to some philosophers, things have temporal parts as well as spatial parts**

 If you have different temporal parts, this would explain how you can exist at different times, and it would also explain how you can have different properties at different times (you-yesterday hasn’t heard of temporal parts, you-tomorrow is an expert)

** can we give criteria of identity through time for artefacts, animals or people? What happens to a ship if you replace all of its planks one by one? What if you keep the old planks, then build a new ship out of them?** In addressing these questions during recent decades, however, it has proven useful to discuss whether objects have temporal parts, because the answers that philosophers give to these questions can often depend upon whether they believe in temporal parts.

# Causation,  Determinism and Free Will

**Is causation analyzable in terms of counterfactuals?**

The simplest analysis analysis through counterfactuals would be :

Event c was a cause of event e if and only if c occurred and e occurred and if c had not occurred, then e would not have occurred.

Determinism: The world is governed by (or is under the sway of) determinism if and only if, given a specified way things are at a time t, the way things go thereafter is fixed as a matter of natural law



# Composition and Mereology

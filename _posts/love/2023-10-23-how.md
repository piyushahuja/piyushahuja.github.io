```
There is no image you can hold
No thought you can think 
That encompasses the Great Self

Your essence
is immortal and unchanging
Yet it is the foundations for all that moves

Rest in the shimmering emptiness
That is the source of the world
And remember who you are
```

I have to be somewhere where I desire something. To get it, I have to be someone, so the thought goes. What is that someone?

I could be :

* spiritual, like a stoic monk.
* generous and giving, as if I were in service.
* a coach or a mentor, full of discernment and life lessons 
* follow rules of behavior I have learnt: about yes/no, needs, wants and boundaries. 
* Nice Guy
* Be in Jan mode, aware of speaking slowly, clearly, lovingly and positively
* outspoken and attention-seeking.
* "in my power": outspoken and status seeking, as a way of channeling eros.
* vulnerable and speak my thoughts, often insecurities.
* vulnerable and keep track of my feelings and vocalise them as they arise.
* playful and humorous, as it provides comfort, flexibility and makes others feel safe.
* try and focus on externals: as in the improv exercise, as a way of maintaing presence.
* Be in a "Yes to Life" mode, expressing every thought, feeling and desire that comes up
* Seek the touch of the beloved in every moment's happening: Making love to every moment
* Follow your fun

Just what was going on in England in the 80s and 90s?

Claudia was in addiction recovery when she discovered a summer school advertisement for surfing.

Lucy was a drug addict, was in relationship with an addict, and talks about the 12 step process a lot.

Sarah Thomas, too.

Debbie spoke about the hanging out with people in warehouse raves or with thousands of people in Glastonbury and no idea of what is going on and being very happy. "There was a general joy and ease around those times" . She used to let non-middle class non-art non-English use her flat as a drug den tip in Glasgow

Joanna Dice might have been into them, and still exploring MDMA and other drugs for growth.

Mary's whole story about her "misspent youth" in the 80s: she left her home for Brighton at 17. She sold clothes to buy drugs. She sold drugs to buy drugs. She was part of a mile long caravan that went from Stonehenge to Montogomery. 

Clare Spooner was into them, and felt judged by a couple of boyfriends for that.

Sammie is still into them. 

Maggie is into the psychedlic society.

It does seem to be a working class thing. 

And maybe a regional thing? Brighton definitely has something going on. 

And the British seem to have carved out a niche for themselves in the realm of Ketamine.

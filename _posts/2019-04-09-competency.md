[Best advice on interviewing](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)

----

Make them say "yes. This is my guy".
Composure is key. Speak slowly, mindfully. It’s better to answer fewer questions in more thorough detail
Am I making sense?

-----


**Response to the code test.** 


----

**The map/reduce via Hadoop involves a lot of boilerplate, so you could take us through that as well.**


----

**The work they do Welcome Sanger?**

- Absorb and extend our use of an on-prem cloud:the code is terraform / ansible. The use is quite focused (standing up & tearing down spark clusters) but as none of us are devops people, we need someone to shoulder that responsibility. 
- Quota-management and budget-management tasks which need a mix of front-end and back-end work (the front-end is mainly for people like me, who cannot stay on top of the administration).

----

**What specifically about working at Sanger interests you?**

- Devops is good for learning. 
- Being around smart people



**What I have?

Experience with relational and non-relational databases
----

**How you’d like to develop?**


- Oppoturtunities to learning  functional languages (Haskell/Erlang) and frotend frameworks like React?
- Cloud technologies (e.g. Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, GitHub CI)
- high performance computing environments (e.g. LSF or Slurm)
- Principle software developer

-----

**Any questions you have?**

* How can I get up to speed with before joining?
    + Docker,  Unix/Shell Scripting, Ansible/Terraform, Apache Spark
* What does your ideal candidate look like?
* How do you typically unwind from work? What do you do in your spare time?
    * Shows personal interest & allows the interviewer to talk about his/her favorite subject - oneself. Creates psychological association with something enjoyable (vacation, hobby etc.). Levels you together.
* How did you get the position you’re at (what skills, achievements etc.)
    * Prompts the interviewer to talk about him/herself, esp. one’s successes. Suggests interest in career at the company/industry & how the firm works on the “people” level. Seeds opportunity to compliment
* How is the work life balance? 




----

**How to do Mock Interviews?**

Write down a list of things that your interviewers should observe you on:

* Do you explain yourself concisely and clearly?
* Do you talk to everyone in turn or do you speak only to the person asking?
* Do you project confidence with your voice and mannerism?
* Do you sound rushed?
* Do you exude enthusiasm?
* How do you handle pressure questions?

Specifically, the interviewer is trying to answer:

* Do I want to be on a team with this person? Can I rely on them and their work?
* Do I want to be stuck on an airplane with this person? Are they interesting?
* Could I put this person in front of a client? Is this person humble, kind, confident?
* Can I throw massive amounts of data and information at this person? Are they organized in their thinking to synthesize what’s most important?’


------

**Research the company to discover specific traits they look for in staff.**  

> These are intended to measure whether you fit with McKinsey culture (or what your interviewer thinks the culture is). That culture is compassionate, humble, curious, creative, intelligent, eager and confident. It honors leadership, integrity and hard work.


> Google values an open culture, interactions between teams, and focuses on providing the best user experience. In an interview for this role, include experiences from your past that demonstrate you align with all of these traits.
Do a quick  brainstorm on what you think a successful Google employee looks like, and tailor your responses to align with this mentality. Get inside the interviewer’s head (not your own). 

Examples of Skills:

- Initiative
- Prioritizaton
    - Manage individual project priorities, deadlines, and deliverables. 
    - focussed on delivering high quality output in a timely manner
- Passion for building great consumer products
- Team Work 
    - Enjoy collaborating and making teammates better by teaching and mentoring.
    - Pair with teammates, review PRs, help others with technical questions & share your learnings.
    -  working collaboratively with various stakeholders within and outside the company 
    - Collaborate across teams and time zones to make things happen, review code and be open to feedback
- Communication: 
    - Capacity to articulate technical problems and projects to all teams
- Eagle eye for detail.
- Curiosity and Mental athleticism. 
    - A wish to jump at the opportunity to dive into new technology and territory. 
    - You’ll be someone who enjoys working on challenges, solving problems and continuously learning
- Optimism, a glass-half-full take on things, enthusiasm
- Comfortable in a fast-paced environment with lots of moving pieces.
- Problem Solvng 
    - You’ll love to problem solve (so probably had a Rubik’s cube at some point in your life) and are happy to constantly challenge to ensure we are continuously improving.
- Analytical, critical and abstract thinking. 
- Out-of-the-box thinking

**Prepare Stories**



Narrative Structure:


* **Situation**: Background of the situation, setting the scene for the interviewer.  Time, setting, position, organization, characters. Conflict, what was it and what caused it.
* **Task**: The specifics of what you were required to do/achieve, when, where, and who. Obstacles  Overcoming lack of resources be they time, money,  innate talent, or people magnifies your accomplishment many fold. Since  we rarely have enough of everything for plans to go smoothly, make sure  you tell the story of the difficulties you faced. what did you realize or have to change about yourself
* **Action**: The steps you actually took, behaviours, characteristics and skills you used.HOW did I do this, explain it in detail. WHY you took certain actions. Did you use a process? What process? How did you get the information to make the decision? How did you bring your team on board with your line of sight? Your accomplishment could be a purely individual and personal one.  And that dish would satisfy, but for most fields, an accomplishment  involving others where you influence, motivate, persuade, cajole, and lead will turn your bread and butter into a delectable delicacy. "what was your initial response?" "how did you overcome those biases?")
* **Result**: Final outcome. What happened, and what you learnt. how did people react, think, fell? Other outcomes?  What happened? How did your customers react? Impact. Your accomplishment must show you as a contributor who has had a significant  impact on a person, organization, or entity. Your accomplishment could be that you increased membership, led a team to victory, built a  coalition in student government that did something fantastic, increased  sales, cut costs, or found a solution to a problem that enabled a  critical deal to go forward.
* (Optional) **Application**. Demonstrate you have grown by using these learnings in a new situation. "how could you have approached the situation differently?”


Some tips:
    
* Answer the question appropriately. For failure, don’t talk about a poor grade or not getting a job. I told a story about how I blasted someone (much higher up), she found out and I had to apologize AND get her to trust me again.
* Present your talents and strengths honestly, don’t embellish negatively or positively. It’s not time to be a sales person nor too modest.
* Draw out the human element; did you understand others? Did you have empathy? Were you compassionate?
* What do you want them to *know*? What do you want them to *feel*? What do you want them to *do*?
* Describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previously employers vis-a-vis increasing revenues or reducing costs.  If you have not had the opportunity to do this yet, describe things which suggest you have the ability to increase revenue or reduce costs, or ideas to do so.

Stories

- Hurricane Sandy
    - The most challenging work I faced was in my first job. I was fresh out of college, and I was tasked with finding the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the US bond market. This was a non-trivial task, requiring both creativity, some hypothesis-making, AS well as technical skills to clean, analyse and train models on large swaths of data. Since I was fresh out of college, I had little experience of the ambiguity and practical challenges of working on a real project. This gave me a first taste of it, I learnt a lot, and by the end of it, I was able to produce a report which was quite respectable. It as even published. 
- Jugnoo Onboarding
- Jugnoo Checkout. Slider forced the user into a more delberative mode of acton
- People:  QC Women Quizmasters
- FB Account Kit in Login/Signup revamp caused the referrals to drop from 18% to 10%
- Aurora German work
- 
- Challenge: Jugnoo Hit the ground running (I was afraid to say  I don't know, and I found it difficult to gain the respect. Learning: it si okay to just listn and learn. respect doesnt come from being a know it all, but from authenticity and giving respect)
- Urvashi (empathy was the key)
- Management of priorities Conflict with Samar over AskLocal vision (Learning: communication was the key; only then I realized He would forget what he told me. )
- Let go of someone (you have to give adequate warning, you have to give reasons which are acceptable to the person, and you have to be compassionate and empathetic yet tough)

Stuff that did not work:
Enrollment and Training of New Drivers (Trust)
- Explaining stuff to Harshal Sanghvi
- NUS Work
- Urvashi and Nitika: The rival Was
    * One would leave early 
    * Or take the testing equipment home
    * Not cover for the other
    * The other would complain about her behind her back
* QC Women Quizmasters
* Awarding the best representative prize to a not-so-good quizzer Anurag Tiwari (QC) 
* Firing Jugnoo employee
* Leaving Jugnoo for entrepreneurship
* Delegating Menu planner to Shivam
* While launching AskLocal, I was stuck with following the whims of the founder in deciding product direction. 
    * Week 1: Copy Zomato Feed. Why are you thinking? First copy then differentiate.
    * Week 2: No one uses Tomato Feed! Why are you not following YikYak?
* Working with a remote designer from Europe
    * She had a data-oriented approach but we did not have the data she needed, was not familiar with our design language: (there was no documentation, it used to change so frequently), and had a different sense of aesthetics from ours. The processes for remote calls were not set in place. 
    * Took guidance from Saurabh Wadhawan
* Rowing team
* IIT Jee
* Oxford
* 6 Pack Abs
* Launching Platonia
* Aurora Data Loading Task
* Referrals in Jugnoo
* AskLocal content: not family friendly and potentially offensive to women vs local knowledge-based
* Jugnoo Star dogfeeding: force company employees to pay and use the new product
* Jugnoo Star First experience management: I actually ended up offending the developers
* Out of court settlement for property infringement. Rs. 1.7 Lakhs eventually (just  market rates) 
    * BATNA: Long court battle - we were not even in the same city. 
    * Approach: Contacted local politicians, tehsildar, instructed Kanugo to reach site on the same day as negotiation etc.
    * Use: Police was on our side and stopped from proceeding construction
* Jugnoo Product Management
    * Always think of ROI. What metrics are you going to effect? Who is being affected?
    * Maintained an excel sheet where the different teams would input the tasks and what priority it had for them. We would highlight taks we were performing and update the expected dates.
* Going home late night for Urvashi

    Sometimes delaying the decision helps: when the time allows more of relevant information to come in. But often we only delay out of fear, confusion, laziness or anxiety. In these cases, there might be a cost of delay, and delaying wouldn’t allay all those emotions or clear the confusion, but only worsen them. If you feel like delaying, you must introspect and be clear about Why you are delaying.
* I recently developed a mobile app from scratch, which about 100+ people used and loved. The app allowed people to connect in-person over skill sharing, and the visition is something I had wanted to execute on since a long time.
    - Since last year, I’ve been the tech lead of Platonia, a startup I founded. 
    - Apart from mentoring junior team members, I've been pretty hands-on with the server side development of the stack of the stack in Node.js
    -  It is currently live on Google Playstore.  Our team of four shipped the product in six months. I designed, implemented, tested and monitor new functionalities to the platform.
    - The product didn't take off with the growth rate needed to justify further time and investment.

**Cover Letter**


Dear Team,

I am an Oxford and IIT Delhi grad, interested in software engineering roles at your company, as mentioned in your [hacker news post](https://news.ycombinator.com/.)
 
Since last year, I’ve been the tech lead of a startup I founded.  Our backend is based on JSON-based RESTful APIs, and utilizes the following stack:  Express, Node.js, Mongodb, AWS. From a previous job at Opera Solutions (which was my first job out of college), I have experience of working on data delivery and storage pipelines for a big data analytics. I am proficient in Java, Javascript frameworks (Node.js, Mocha, Chai, Sinon), RESTful API design, data modelling, using version controls systems like Git, and implementing authentificiaton frameworks (including Oauth and Oauth 2.0)

In between those two stints, I have been product manager of a consumer-facing on-demand services app used by about 3 million users across 28 cities in India. As a product manager, I led a team of 15, made product roadmaps, conducted user research and wrote detailed user journeys for the developers to implement. Before that, I read PPE at Oxford. Both these experiences instilled in me good interpersonal and communication skills which I have found to be very valuable in my career.

I am currently based in India, seeking new opportunities, and looking to relocate.  

Summary: 

* Graduated from IIT Delhi with a five-year integrated masters (bachelors + masters) in computer science  in 2013
* Worked at a big data analytics company as an an analytics specialist (13-14) 
* Graduated from Oxford in PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics) as a second undergrad degree in 2016 Worked as a product manager in a consumer-facing tech startup (16-17)
* Founded a startup and led a team of four to ship the flagship product, currently live on Google Playstore  (2017- present)

Please find attached my CV.  I also maintain a professional website, where you could find more details about my background: http://piyushahuja.github.io. 

Looking forward to hearing from you! 

Regards,   
Piyush

**My Intro/Tell me about yourself/Why I am the perfect fit for this specific opportunity? (Suggest, not tell)**

-  My first degree was in **Computer Science**  **After that, I went to Oxford** for a two years degree in humanities. PPE. I was one of the few places where you could get that in two years, and it is also one of the best, I went there to read for a second undergrad degree
    *  **"The ability to quickly pick stuff up or learn new things"**. For example, reading under the rigors of the tutorial system at Oxford has helped me develop time management skills and an ability to get work done under pressure. In software there are always new frameworks coming up, or you have to understand the API documentation quickly and quickly integrate it. 
    *  A diverse background in also gives me ability to approach a problem from different perspectives and assimilate knowledge from different fields.

- **My first job out of Oxford was in a  startup in the on-demand sector** as a product manager, Jugnoo.  It was **consumer facing app** used by about **3 million consumers across 28 cities** in India. 
    - One thing I got out of that role was a  complete obsession with user experience and **experience handling large-scale, high-volume services.**- Having seen both sides, I have a focus on customer experience
    * I can come up with clever ways to improve usage including behavioural economics and design improvements. 

-  Since last year, I’ve been working on a product called Platonia. Apart from mentoring junior team members, I've been **pretty hands-on with the server side development of the stack of the stack in Node.js**  It is currently live on Google Playstore.  Our team of four  shipped the product in six months. 
> The product didn't take off with the growth rate needed to justify further time and investment.


 

----

**Why did you go for PPE?**

* I wanted a more well rounded educaton. I went for a two years degree in humanities. Oxford was one of the few places where you could get that in two years, and it is also one of the best, I went there to read for a second undergrad degree 
    * A diverse background in also gives me ability to approach a problem from different perspectives and assimilate knowledge from different fields.
    *  **"The ability to quickly pick stuff up or learn new things"**.
        * For example, reading under the rigors of the tutorial system at Oxford has helped me develop time management skills and an ability to get work done under pressure. In software there are always new frameworks coming up, or you have to understand the API documentation quickly and quickly integrate it. 
   


--------

**What are you looking for?**

- I am looking for specialize further in the backend. Experience in high quality, production grade application with established tech practices, without the scrappyness of a startup.
    - there's a lot of new, interesting challenges that I'd expect come up in day to day. Interesting problems:
    - new local method (Brazil has cash based, )
    - Challenges of securty and scale. 
    - Improving P.O.S. software using protocols standards, websocket 
- At the same time, it should not have complex hierarchies.  At this stage of my career, I am looking for a role which gives me a significant amount of ownership. This would great for learning, growth, and taking on real responsibility. 

s


- As a person who wants to move fast make an impact, it would probablyy not suit me to work in a company with complex hierarchies or bureacracy. 
Speed is the foundation of Ayden. We think, work and ship fast. 



-----
**Why company X?**


- **Takes Tech Very Seriously**
    - Great tech practices. I have been following your blog.
- **Personable People**
> I talked to Rik Nijesson and Burak Yildrim, and both were very personable and encouraging.  


<!-- - **Work Culture** 
 >  There’s always something happening, from fiercely competitive quiz nights*

 -->

<!-- 
- **Mission**:
>  Tech used for a meaninful purpose.

**Why should we select you?** (Tell, not suggest)

 
- To put it simply, I get work done. 
    - I have worked in any environment where this ability was
    - At Jugnoo, we had weekly sprints, my team delivered one impactful feature every week.  
    - At Oxford, I had two submit two essays week-in-week out.
    - I believe in writing software which is easy to read, test,  maintain or extend. But I also understand well trade-offs between perfection and time. Often you have to just delivery. Often its not about your code being perfect, but about iterative fast on product features. 

-  I can see both perspectives: product managers and developers, I have a focus on customer experience


----

**What are your strengths?**

Strengths

* I get work done
* I am good at thinking in abstract terms - mathematics and philosophy. 


-----


**What motivates you?** **What are you passionate about?**

- I am passionate about learning new things. 
    - This is what drove me to major in major in both and engineering. I did PPE at Oxford and CS in IIT Delhi, and this is what drove me to software engineering. There is so much to learn! I feel the experience of learning something fresh is what keeps you alive and kicking. Otherwise the world is a little boring.  
- Simplifying complex things


-----

**Passion for tech and metacognition about coding well**

-  I am proficient in Java - which is strongly typed, object oriented, class-based. Transferring that knowleedge to <X>  would be trivial. 
    -  I prefer statically typed and compiled languages (rather than interpreted ones). They tell me about errors in my code before I run any tests altogether, and once you get used to the boilerplate, you stop even noticing it. It is like dental hygiene, except for code.

----

**What are your weaknesses**

-----




**What's something you've worked on that you've been proud of?**

What has been your greatest achievement?

* The thing that I am most proud of was the I was able to fulfill one of my childhood dreams
* Situation: When I was young
hich project are you most proud of?
- Since last year, I’ve been the tech lead of Platonia, a startup I founded. 
- Apart from mentoring junior team members, I've been **pretty hands-on with the server side development of the stack of the stack in Node.js** 
-  It is currently live on Google Playstore.  Our team of four shipped the product in six months. I designed, implemented, tested and monitor new functionalities to the platform.
- The product didn't take off with the growth rate needed to justify further time and investment. *

 How do you work in teams?
- Collaborate across teams and time zones to make things happen, review code and be open to feedback


-----


**Briefly, what do you like & dislike about your current or latest role?**

What I liked best about my latest role was that it gave me a lot of autonomy, which made me both disciplined and empowered at the same time!

------

**What's the most challenging work you've faced?** (the strangest bug you had to debug on production, the most awful legacy system you needed to interface with, etc... this doesn't need to be a success story) **Tell me an experience where you have <fill in a challenge> in your job, and what  have you done to overcome the challenge?**




----

**Tell me about a time you led people to do something they didn’t want to do.** 

----


**Tell me about a time you failed and how you overcame that failure.**


-----

**Tell me about a time you had to change your mind in front of others, what happened?**



----


**Tell me about a time you had to work hard to meet a deadline that was virtually impossible. What did you do? How did you prioritize?**







-------


**Experience making system architecture decisions (which stack to use, choice of storage enginers, whether to use microservices)**

**Situation:** During the shipping of Platonia, we made quite a few architectural choices

**Task:** Choose a database for the application. SQL based like PostGreSQL (Relational) vs Mongo (NoSql) or Graph(Neo4J)

**Action:**

- Made a list of properties we needed from our database
- Increase speed of writing code and deploying. Presence of an online community and f libraries we can take off-the-shel and wire together  (Ruled out Graph databases)
    - Something well known: Ease of hiring developers (Ruled out Graph databases)
    - Schema flexibiliy in light of evolving data model (Ruled out SQL databases)
- Something thats Scalable, since if it takes off it should be able to handle loads of millons (Ruled out SQL databases)
- Chose MongoDb based on the above propertes
    - Mongo has many features that you think about relational database: support for joins, indexing and searching on nested data.

Sometimes delaying the decision helps: when the time allows more of relevant information to come in. But often we only delay out of fear, confusion, laziness or anxiety. In these cases, there might be a cost of delay, and delaying wouldn’t allay all those emotions or clear the confusion, but only worsen them.
If you feel like delaying, you must introspect and be clear about Why you are delaying.

Learning 4
- Becoming aware of unspoken contracts of giving and receiving
- After: Joyfull giving, and receiving, with no strings attached


having honest communication with a friend who I experience as taking me for granted - and owning where I’ve over-compensated for this imbalance, fuelling my resentment. Key insight: if I don’t value my time and energy, of course the world will mirror this in different ways. Again, this is energetic feedback of where the energy doesn’t flow harmoniously within and outside of me. Being discerning about how I show up in close friendships is in the spotlight. Do I expect too much from them in the absence of a life partner at this time? And when I disown my Muse, my creative gifts, I disrupt healthy exchange with others.

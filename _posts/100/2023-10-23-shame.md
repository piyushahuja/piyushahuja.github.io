Bjorn Erik on not being chosen: "I felt shame" (inspired by Charity)



The same goes for the situations many find themselves in where they don’t want to speak their experience because they are looking for the right thing to say. In those cases an expression could be “I am looking for the right thing to say.”

There is often great potential in sharing both the immediate reaction “I feel angry” and the fear or sense of holding back that is present in the situation “I feel angry AND I am afraid of bringing it, because it feels like someone is going to attack me now”.

“I am feeling provoked by what you are saying AND I am afraid of taking up space, because I can see that Y is in the middle of something important AND it feels important for me to bring all of this now AND saying this I both feel empowered and a bit shy.” Circling thus revolves around noticing what is going on in the present moment and sharing (WHAT I am experiencing and HOW I experience it ) or moving from there. The focus is on what is present right now, in us and between us. Even if we circle on a specific theme (i.e. “our business plan for 2020”) we would focus on how we relate to it in this very moment and what it does to how we relate.

It is also about focusing on my body-being to see if there is anything that wants to be seen or heard rather than explaining why a discomfort or resistance is there (”maybe this resistance can teach me something that I haven’t realized yet”) and moving from vagueness to clear transmissions of that which deeply matters, although this often feels uncomfortable. Revealing ambivalence can be part of this (”I am feeling fear, but I also seem to like what you are saying”).

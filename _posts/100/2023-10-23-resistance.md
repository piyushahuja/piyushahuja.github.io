The idea: This is a rewiring of the patterns that can keep me stuck in thought loops. rewrite limiting beliefs and embody new ones.
- Find Limiting Belief The inner critic tends to be harsher. Replace it with something that is true-er to reality.  Is it really true? Get the sting out, not darkly pessimistic.
	- Learning from resistance and releasing it It is also about focusing on my body-being to see if there is anything that wants to be seen or heard rather than explaining why a discomfort or resistance is there (”maybe this resistance can teach me something that I haven’t realized yet”) and moving from vagueness to clear transmissions of that which deeply matters, although this often feels uncomfortable. 
- Rewrite Replace the inner critic with a fact.  The statement should be about the present, not something that you want or in the future. (Circling revolves around noticing what is going on in the present moment and sharing (WHAT I am experiencing and HOW I experience it ) or moving from there. The focus is on what is present right now, in us and between us. Even if we circle on a specific theme (i.e. “our business plan for 2020”) we would focus on how we relate to it in this very moment and what it does to how we relate.)
- And Embrace the resistance. It sets the energy free. 
	- “And I was noticing these young cynical, jaded atheistic shut down mechanisms kicking off, I accepted this and welcomed those resistances as a part of my ride.  - James Buchanan
	- Searching for the beloved in those moments looked like a deep acceptance of myself and the situation in that instant. Yes to my resistance yes to my stuckness, yes to my confusion, yes to the tyranny of my personality. “ I cannot shame myself into change, I can only love myself into evolution” (Laura on saying Yes to Resistance == Deep accceptance in that instant)
- Embody: Gently embrace the whole statement. Let the sentences sink in your heart, befriends the feelings. 


There is often great potential in sharing both the immediate reaction “I feel angry” (Yes) and the fear or sense of holding back that is present in the situation (RESISTANCE) “I feel angry AND I am afraid of bringing it, because it feels like someone is going to attack me now”. 
(Not rejecting anything, not even resistance - Carol”)

“I am feeling provoked by what you are saying AND I am afraid of taking up space, because I can see that Y is in the middle of something important AND it feels important for me to bring all of this now AND saying this I both feel empowered and a bit shy.” 

"I was drawn to the idea of being willing to put my honest thoughts and feelings out there for the world to see, and to explore which aspects of my self might resonate with others. I hoped to feel a greater ability to make choices without overthinking them and without trying to make them perfect (or waiting for the perfect moment to act/speak). Now, I find myself more willing to say yes to others and to myself and having greater confidence in the idea that even if the choice I am making is imperfect, I'll still be able to make something good out of it."

“I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all… I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.”

Examples of Resistances
- Fear of the Unknown
	- As I worked through my Yes/But statements, it became clear that my biggest Buts were about a fear of the unknown. So my work now is to surrender and trust. (Spice Mags)
- Fear of being attacked
- Fear of being deceived
	- “I want to believe…but I’m so scared of being deceived again.” This transformed into, “I have experienced Oneness with the Beloved since I was a young girl, and as a child I named That Jesus.”  (Charity)
- Fear of being too much (loving, sexual)
	- “I have strong sexual energy, but I am often too much.” to  “I celebrate my vast and wild sexual energy, and I celebrate it consciously and with reverence. And when someone can meet me all the way up there, with consciousness, trust, and love…it is utter bliss.”  (Charity)
	- Yes, I’m loving and sometimes I worry that I’m too much.  to Yes, I’m loving and I enjoy sharing my love. And yes, I know that some will want to share my love, that some may find it too much and that, yes, for some my love may not be enough.  This comes with a sense of ease, freedom and depth in my hear (Karen)
- Fear of taking up too much space
- Right thing to say. The same goes for the situations many find themselves in where they don’t want to speak their experience because they are looking for the right thing to say. In those cases an expression could be “I am looking for the right thing to say.” (Circling article)
- Fear of hurt of separation
	- “I am starting to open my tender heart, but I fear the darkness will crush me when I am separated.” This transformed into: “I am softening my enormous heart, and am saddened by separation. And it’s worth it. Soft and sad is vastly better than cold and hard.” (Charity)
- Fear of people wanting things, being used (Flora, Joanna)
- Fear of being taken for granted, being a doormat
- Fear of being friendzoned 
- Fear of abandonment or being forgotten (Ginta, Becky, Clare, Francesca)
- Fear of disappointing/being seen as yourself/not being good enough
- As a protector: “resistance is a protector, and of the depth of despair from long ago that it’s protecting against.” - Alex


Alex
“I’m so used to getting caught up in my “but”s, and then experiencing various forms of distress about my supposed lack of aliveness, creativity and flow.  There was a lot of resistance around for me during the week - yet somehow I was still able to participate, open, serve others, connect, dance and learn.  The yes was there, available all the time; the field of love we created made it more immediately apparent and accessible, but I glimpsed the fact that it’s always there, even if the resistance doesn’t believe that.  And I glimpsed also a real understanding that the resistance is a protector, and of the depth of despair from long ago that it’s protecting against.  What LT4 showed me was that I am not just my resistances; and that I need this kind of community of love to keep remembering that - I can’t do it on my own.  I’m left with gratitude, appreciation and a sense of faith.”

Elke
“After LT4, I am with a new quality of being that can hold and embrace everything. That not only can hold, but longs for holding what I had usually pushed away and tried to not let come close to me – the spikiness of other people’s judgements, the stuckness of drama and victimhood, gossip, pretentiousness – essentially energies that I had perceived as threatening because they keep my life energy low. I had felt a need to protect myself against them (e.g. by imagining a pink bubble surrounding myself that bounces off “toxic” energies). 

Practicing with you all this week made me realise that when I surrender to my fears and anxieties – a lot of life energy is set free. This energy that is set free by surrendering to what is, is a pro-active loving creative force. She calls me home to the place where: “I give myself to the world. I use my gifts and skills and I have many. I am confident and capable. I care. I mother – I embrace and hold everyone lovingly and kindly. I am excited to meeting you”. In this place, there is no drama or running away or ego or hesitation. Everything is possible! It feels very adult. Very alive! Colours, sounds, and smells are intensified. There’s a lot of drive – in a powerful and gentle way, coming from a place of allowing, rather than pushing or overstretching myself. 

Now that I’m back in CH and back at work I do notice how I fall back into patterns that disconnect me from “being at home” AND I am aware of them. This awareness is so precious. There is now a subtle and very powerful fire burning inside of me – which cannot be unseen and undone. I keep dancing with everything that is. I drop back into my body, again and again and again. Feeling my heart and sex pulsating…”

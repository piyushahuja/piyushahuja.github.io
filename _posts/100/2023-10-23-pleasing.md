Pattern:

I want someone to like me. If someone doesn't like me, I want to do things to make them like me.

The Problem: 

* A connection is not your sole responsbility: it is carried by two. There is a division of responsibility. By fixing a connection, doing all the work, you're taking on their responsibility for them.  
* To do things to get someone to like you is manipulative: it has an agenda "to get". 



-------


Antidote: 

* Do NOT take on responsibility for what is NOT your responsibility.  Taking responsibility for things that are not yours to own is a form of appeasement, which can happen when a Man is intimidated by a Woman and wants to make her anger or disappointment go away. Do not allow yourself to be blamed for agreements that were never made and expectations that were not communicated to you clearly. Let her know that you love and cherish her, but that kind of stuff is not going to fly with you.

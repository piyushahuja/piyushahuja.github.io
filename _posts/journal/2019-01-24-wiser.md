When I was younger, I used to read the works of great writers and feel a certain kinship to them. Reading a book, I would often go, “So true! This is how I feel as well!”. Because great writers wrote about some of the same stuff I used to think about, I would tell myself that I must be wise like them.

Now that I am older, I realize that I felt close to them not because I was anything like them, but because they, being great writers, wrote about stuff *anyone* would relate to. That's what had made them great in the first place. Their work was timeless and universal. I related to their writings not because I was wise, but because they were.

And having had this wise epiphany about my own erstwhile stupidity, I (again) tell myself that I must have *now* become wiser. No doubt, at some later point of life, I would again realize the follies of what I now consider wisdom. Maybe this is what all wisdom is: an ever-increasing appreciation of your own stupidity.

There was a time explore and live life to the fullest. I want to live like an intellectual nomad, listening to and telling stories to travellers over bonfires, surviving in the wilderness, cooking raw meat, reading books and writing them, surfing couches and backpacker dorms, volunteering. 

I wanted to travel to the edges of civilisation and experience the wonders of the planet. I wanted to witness the ice sheets of Antarctica, the jungles of Amazon, the sands of Africa, the arid dry desert of Mongolia. the volcanoes of Indonesia, the tribes of Papua New Guinea, and  the lagoons of the Pacific. 

I wanted to travel on a ship and swim with marine animals, gaze at the stars and the milky way, and observe the majesty of animals in the wild.


I wanted to make love to strong women travellers. 

I wanted to sailing seas on a private yacht. I wanted to sit Oxford with my mates, sipping wine while discussing world politics. I wanted to tell jokes, be the life of a party, and waltz with beautiful women. I am supposed to come up with wittizicms on the fly.  I wanted to host house parties and travellers. 

Travelling around the world seems cool. But visualising yourself at awesome places is a fantasy where you usually leave out your own inner psychology: imagine as you are, right now. If you were transported to your dream vacation place, would you be happy?  Imagine the anxieties you will feel:  being jobless and aimless in life and not adding meaning to anyone else's, of not making a lasting impression etc.  Would would take care of Mom and Richa? Does the idea still seem cool?

This is empty, meaningless, hollow. Travelling without meaning is like sex without love. 

I want to do these meaningfully, to create something out of them, a work of art which reveals a philosophy. A bit like this inspirational lady, who was one degree of separation away from me at Oxford: [Grace Young](http://www.graceunderthesea.com/)

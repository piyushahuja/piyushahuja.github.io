The lives and careers of most people will be decidedly mundane.  They will not be rich, famous, attractive or powerful; they will not reach the pinnacle of sports, entertainment, academia, politics, or business. No Olympic Medal, no Oscar, no Nobel Prize, no Prime Ministership, no billion-dollar wealth.

I turned 30 this year. By now I have come to terms with the fact that my life will be like the lives of most people. I am O.K. with that. But before I shuffle off the mortal coil, I would like to take a shot at two ventures: (1) building a company, and (2) writing a novel. 

What would my ideal venture achieve for me, personally? What would success look like?

It would not be a billion dollar exit, delivering me a short-lived spell of corporate power,  a modicum of fame, and some riches. Success would not be a destination. The only thing one becomes on reaching a destination is a "has-been".

Instead, success would be a life of continued meaning and play in the present. A job which ensures financial security, autonomy, creative self expression and inner fulfillment. A venture which allows me to work with people whose company I enjoy and whose respect and admiration I am able to earn.

*Belongingness* is the feeling what my ideal job would have. Belongingness to a community, a community which does for the creative potential of academics, philosophers, mathematicians, artists and computer scientists what an institutition like Y Combinator did for entrepreneurs.[^Community] A community that has salon-like socials where I am able to flourish and live an eventful, sparkling life. [^Personalities] 

[^Community]:  Something like the [The Chelsea Hotel](https://medium.com/@bagelboy/make-america-bohemian-again-de846e35d757), or Or British secret societies: [The Apostles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Apostles)  or [The Bloomsbury Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group) come to mind. The English gentleman's clubs like [The Hawks Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawks%27_Club), and institutions like Cumberland Lodge are also alternative models of the same idea. The community bring back the spirit of [Penny Universities](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/the-penny-universities/), or the culture of [coffeehouses in Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_coffeehouses_in_the_17th_and_18th_centuries) or [French Salons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering)). Some communities which are similar, but in different ways: [Math Circles](https://mathcircles.org/), [Dynamic Land](https://dynamicland.org/#project), [Recurse Centre](https://www.fastcompany.com/90325497/this-coders-retreat-is-rewriting-all-the-rules-to-boost-diversity), [Interrelect](https://www.interintellect.com/), [LessWrong](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups), [Openmaster](https://www.openmasters.org/who).

[^Personalities]: Some people who lived lives like this are [Andre Weil](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201801/rnoti-p54.pdf) or [Gore Vidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gore_Vidal) or Stephen Fry or [AJ Ayer](https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/jun/20/featuresreview.review4)


[^Examples]: Examples:  Upright Citizens Brigade, The Cambridge Footlights, [The Oxford Imps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oxford_Imps), Fry and Laurie, Mitchell and Webb, [All India Bakchod](All_India_Bakchod), College Humour

Finally, my ideal job would also allow me to (1) be part of creative projects, as part of an improv troupe or a sketch comedy collective[^Examples], (2) do something in mathematics, computer science and philosophy education for kids (3) to improve the lives of those on society's margin: the poor, old and the infirm. 

It looks like a case of asking too much. And it very likely is. It is probably too idealistic, unrealistic, deluded, midguided and a recipe for failure and disappointment. 

But I would still try.

The lives and careers of most people will be decidedly average.  They will not rich, famous, attractive or powerful; you will not reach the pinnacle of sports, entertainment, academia, politics, or business. An Olympic Medal, an Oscar, a Nobel Prize, or Prime Ministership, or a billion-dollar wealth are within reach of only a handful

I turned 30 this year, and I will be like most people.


Consider the careers chosen by most graduates of an elite education: law, medicine, consulting, academia, finance, and engineering. Climbing the meritocratic ladder in these fields requires incredible smarts, work-ethic and competitiveness. They demand complete devotion in the prime years of your life: most of your 20s and early 30s.   The rewards are an above-average income, highly educated coworkers, and prestigious careers in institutions that take care of life's basic needs.  A comfortable existence in the upper reaches of the middle class, inaccessible to most.

What about the non-elite careers? These include positions as administraters, accountants, HR, tax advisors, real estate agents, government officials, customer service representives; all honorable jobs with important roles in our society.

Then there are nurses, teachers, civil servants and leaders of small or medium-sized businesses.




[^Medicine]: Newly qualified doctors enter a two-year Foundation Programme, where they undertake terms in a variety of different specialities. These must include training in General Medicine and General Surgery but can also include other fields such as Paediatrics, Anaesthetics or General Practice. Following completion of the Foundation Programme a doctor can choose to specialise in one field. All routes involve further assessment and examinations. To train as a general practitioner (GP), after completing the Foundation Programme, a doctor must complete eighteen months of posts in a variety of hospital specialities - often including paediatrics, psychiatry, geriatrics and obstetrics & gynaecology. The trainee also has to spend eighteen months as a General Practice Speciality Registrar - a trainee based in a GP practice. After completing this training and the relevant exams, the doctor can become a GP and can practise independently.

[^Law]: Generally, it will take eight or more years to make partner at a large commercial firm. the senior partner is elected by the firm’s partners to serve a three-year term and is typically re-elected until they step down from the role or someone else voices an interest in the position. the Magic Circle - comprised of London's five most prestigious law firms - currently offer first year trainees salaries in the region of £45,000 to £48,000. Once trainees reach their second year salaries rise to between £51,000 and £54,000.

**What would my ideal venture achieve?**


Success would not be a billion dollar exit, where I am briefly powerful,  receive a modicum of fame, and become insanely rich. Success would not be a destination, on reaching which I would become a "has-been". 

Instead, it would be a life of continued meaning and play in the present. A job which ensures a basic level of financial security, autonomy, creative self expression and inner fulfillment. A venture which allows me to work with people whose company I enjoy and whose respect and admiration I am at the receiving end of.

To be part of a community like [The Chelsea Hotel](https://medium.com/@bagelboy/make-america-bohemian-again-de846e35d757), or the English gentleman's clubs like [The Hawks Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawks%27_Club), or secret societies like [The Apostles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Apostles)  or [The Bloomsbury Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group). Or Cumberland Lodge to be more realistic. Something that I am uniquely position to bring into existence: an institution that does for the creative potential of academics, philosophers, mathematicians, artists and computer scientists what Y Combinator did for entrepreneurs.

To flourish in events like the [Penny Universities](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/the-penny-universities/), or the culture of [coffeehouses in Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_coffeehouses_in_the_17th_and_18th_centuries) or [French Salons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering)) or Math Circles. To live life like [Andre Weil](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201801/rnoti-p54.pdf) or [Gore Vidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gore_Vidal) or Stephen Fry.

To bring to life creative projects, as part of an improv troupe, a sketch comedy duo or a comedy collective Examples: [All India Bakchod](All_India_Bakchod), Upright Citizens Brigade, The Cambridge Footlights, [The Oxford Imps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oxford_Imps), Fry and Laurie, Mitchell and Webb, College Humour. 

I would like to do something for marginalised people: the poor, old and the infirm. 

I would like to do something in mathematics, computer science and philosophy education.

The lives and careers of most people will be decidedly mundane.  They will not be rich, famous, attractive or powerful; they will not reach the pinnacle of sports, entertainment, academia, politics, or business. No Olympic Medal, no Oscar, no Nobel Prize, no Prime Ministership, no billion-dollar wealth.

I turned 30 this year. By now I have come to terms with the fact that my life will be like the lives of most people. I am O.K. with that. But before I shuffle off the mortal coil, I would like to take a shot at two ventures: (1) building a company, and (2) writing a novel. 

What would my ideal company achieve?


Success would not be a billion dollar exit, where I am briefly powerful,  receive a modicum of fame, and become insanely rich. Success would not be a destination, on reaching which I would become a "has-been". 

Instead, it would be a life of continued meaning and play in the present. A job which ensures a basic level of financial security, autonomy, creative self expression and inner fulfillment. A venture which allows me to work with people whose company I enjoy and whose respect and admiration I am at the receiving end of.

A company which forms a community like [The Chelsea Hotel](https://medium.com/@bagelboy/make-america-bohemian-again-de846e35d757), or the English gentleman's clubs like [The Hawks Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawks%27_Club), or secret societies like [The Apostles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Apostles)  or [The Bloomsbury Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group). Or Cumberland Lodge, for an example I have experienced.  Something that I am uniquely position to bring into existence: an institution that does for the creative potential of academics, philosophers, mathematicians, artists and computer scientists what Y Combinator did for entrepreneurs.

A job where I flourish in events like the [Penny Universities](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/the-penny-universities/), or the culture of [coffeehouses in Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_coffeehouses_in_the_17th_and_18th_centuries) or [French Salons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering)) or Math Circles. To live life like [Andre Weil](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201801/rnoti-p54.pdf) or [Gore Vidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gore_Vidal) or Stephen Fry or [AJ Ayer](https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/jun/20/featuresreview.review4)

To bring to life creative projects, as part of an improv troupe, a sketch comedy duo or a comedy collective Examples:  Upright Citizens Brigade, The Cambridge Footlights, [The Oxford Imps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oxford_Imps), Fry and Laurie, Mitchell and Webb, [All India Bakchod](All_India_Bakchod), College Humour. 

A job which allows me to do something for marginalised people: the poor, old and the infirm. 

A job which allows me to do something in mathematics, computer science and philosophy education.

I turned 30 this year.  

What would I count as a successful outcome of my venture?

Success would not be an good exit, where I am briefly powerful,  little famous and eventually become a multimillionaire. Success would not be a destination. 

Instead, it would be a life of continued enjoyment in the "present", with a basic level of financial security, autonomy, creative self expression and inner fulfillment, working with people whose company I enjoy and whose respect and admiration I get. 

I would like to be built an institution like [The Chelsea Hotel](https://medium.com/@bagelboy/make-america-bohemian-again-de846e35d757). The English gentleman's clubs like [The Hawks Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawks%27_Club), or secret societies like [The Apostles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Apostles)  or [The Bloomsbury Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group) come close. Cumberland Lodge is more open. But then, it has to be something that I am uniquely position to build: like Y Combinator for Academics/Artists/IITians. 

I would like to have organize events like the [Penny Universities](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/the-penny-universities/), like the ones in [coffeehouses in Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_coffeehouses_in_the_17th_and_18th_centuries) or [French Salons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering))

I would like to be part of creative projects, like an Improv Troupe, a Sketch Comedy Duo or a comedy collective Examples: All India Bakchod, Citizens Upright Brigade, The Cambridge Footlights, Oxford Imps, Fry and Laurie, Mitchell and Webb. I would like to make podcasts and write opinion pieces. 

I would like to do something for marginalised people: the poor, old and the infirm. 

I would like to do something in education: especially mathematics, computer science and philosophy.

Six industries: law, medicine, consulting, academia, finance, and engineering. Climbing the meritocratic ladder of these industries requires incredible smarts, work-ethic and competitiveness over a decade in your 20s and early 30s. The rewards are an above-average income, highly educated coworkers, and prestigious careers in institutions that take care of life's basic needs. They would lead you to a upper-middle class life.

Ignore, for a moment the rest: administration, HR, SMEs, accountants, tax advisors, real estate agents, nurses, teachers, government officials, civil servants. These are honorable jobs with important roles in our society, but they do not take a decade of extreme competitiveness.


[^Medicine]: Newly qualified doctors enter a two-year Foundation Programme, where they undertake terms in a variety of different specialities. These must include training in General Medicine and General Surgery but can also include other fields such as Paediatrics, Anaesthetics or General Practice. Following completion of the Foundation Programme a doctor can choose to specialise in one field. All routes involve further assessment and examinations. To train as a general practitioner (GP), after completing the Foundation Programme, a doctor must complete eighteen months of posts in a variety of hospital specialities - often including paediatrics, psychiatry, geriatrics and obstetrics & gynaecology. The trainee also has to spend eighteen months as a General Practice Speciality Registrar - a trainee based in a GP practice. After completing this training and the relevant exams, the doctor can become a GP and can practise independently.

[^Law]: Generally, it will take eight or more years to make partner at a large commercial firm. the senior partner is elected by the firm’s partners to serve a three-year term and is typically re-elected until they step down from the role or someone else voices an interest in the position. the Magic Circle - comprised of London's five most prestigious law firms - currently offer first year trainees salaries in the region of £45,000 to £48,000. Once trainees reach their second year salaries rise to between £51,000 and £54,000.

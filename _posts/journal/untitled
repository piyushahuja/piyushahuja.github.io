rational school:  We can use reason to prove the existence of God, soul and tell right from wrong. 

Hume: Reason is a slave to passions. It can tell us how to get what we want, but not what is right.

Rousseau: reason can be destructive. I am happy, but then I compare myself to others. I turn out to be less happy, than if I did not have reason at all.

Kant: brings the two together

Critique of pure reason:
We cannot know about human freedom. We cannot know whether God exists.


Trying to extend Newtonian Analysis to Philosophy.

What is moral value? Is there such a thing? Its not difficult. The normal peasant can tell right from wrong.
Core idea: look at the subject's will. any being who has a minimum of rationality.

What is moral goodness? It has a character of being unconditional good. Umbrella is good for keeping from rain. But moral actions are good on any circumstance.

The only thing that is an unconditional good, is a good will: an individual's capacity to form intentions, and commit to them, form plans. 

Lots of goods: strength of character (to bully), wish and imagination (to humilitate). can use for bad purposes. 

Inward turn: not looking for moral value in conventions, divine lawgiver, or consequences.

How do we get to objectivity? How does a subject achieve objective truth?

Shopkeeper doesnt rip off the customers. Right thing to do. But what about his reasons? (say just prudential reason based on reputation) vs the other does it based on principle. not enough to do right, but have to do for the right reasons. 


deeper idea: morality has to be pure, independent of contingence, of anyting that is empirical, changing etc.

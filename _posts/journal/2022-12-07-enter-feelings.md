**July: The Initiation**

I felt the presence of the divine feminine. Her breasts grazed my chest. Her hair fell on my body. Her fragrance...

Love was in the air. In the energy field.  

I saw a vision.It was the dawn of civilization. I was an one of the early men. I was Purush. I was Adam.  The land was densely forested, possibly Ancient India. I was unclothed. In the centre of my heart was the spiritual light I was carrying. And besides me was the community of other spiritual beings. 

When the thought came as to what we have done,  to this planet, to ourselves, our burst into tears.

In those two hours, I let go of all the wounds, all the sadness that I carried, all the memories of rejection and heartache. 

And when I emerged, I was alive, fresh, reborn, as I was when I was little.

We ate. Me in silence, others in playful. 

A rainbow shone outside.

**S**


For the next two weeks, I was on a high. I had vivid dreams. I uttered S's name in my sleep. I let go of any to-do list. I listend to LT music. 

I bought a car. A Blue Volksvagen Tiguan. "Flirzy", as Sarah would call it.

I wrote S a letter in Cafe Chill, posted it via the post office next to Grafton, and refreshed the web page every day to check whether it has been received. It went on for 6-7 pages. It was "intense", as she would describe later.

She replied immediately. A lukewarm one, to my dismay, but also to my expectation.  C'est Le Vie. Life goes on.

Two months later, I drove into Earthspirit for the seminar. She wasn't there. 

I joined the training.

---

On 8th November, 2011, I messaged S, asking after her. She replied and suggested we chat on phone.

I was a little nervous calling but I manned up and took her offer. She was taking a walk outside the house. We chatted. We laughed. 

Three days later, as I was switching off my phone for LT2, I left her a voice note, asking if she'd like to meet, never expecting she'd say Yes.  She did.


---

On my way to Burnley, I stopped by Oxford. I bought her a book. We spoke on phone. She was loving. She said I'd be loved and fed. 

----

She was dressed in all black jeans and top as she stood in the doorway and looked around for me. She failed to spot me even though I was right there. 

We chatted. 

She proposed we try dancing, Cha-cha or something, that she was learning through videos on her iPAD.

That night, we made love.


We drove to Toddmorden and had coffee. Then we went to Hebden Bridge and had lunch.

As we parted, we kissed. 

----


 I messaged her from London on 14th December. We agreed to meet again.


We met in Matlock.


---


We met in Ashdown Forest. 


---

She was a supply teacher from Burnley. She grew up in Durham. Her father, who was with the university, left the family for an affair. Her mother was depressed. She had a sister who lived in Brighton.

She strugged with drugs in the 90s, with the rave scene. Her first fiance was found hanging the day after the eclipse in 1999. She had another partner that last a decade but who did not really love her. She spent another decade lost.

**D**

She was the first woman whose yoni I entered. 

I first met het at the seminar. She was sitting on the bench, talking about wikipedia or catterpillars or something. 


She was born in Portsmouth, spent some of her childhood in Cambridge, and later grew up in Cornwall. She conducted arts workshop for young kids, she'd tell me over dinner in Castle Cary.

I met her parents, both retired doctors, at their house next to Minack Theatre in Pothcurno in Cornwall. Her father showed me around the theatre and Land's End.

Her partner, R, was polyamourous.

**J**

She was from St. Ives in Cornwall. I met her in MWM in London.
She lived in Brighton,  a nurse turned psychotherapist specialising in psychedelics.

Divorced, a mother of two, and polyamourous.

She liked to dance, wear oily scents, and had a fun side to her.

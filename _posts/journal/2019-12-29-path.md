**Find your inner compass**

Inner compass is different from thoughts, and it is different from the voice in your heads. The voice in your head is formed from beliefs, stereotypes, even language and habitual ways of thinking. Think of them as forces that have colonized humanity.

The inner compass is a feeling.  It feels free. It exists in the space and life beyond thoughts. Its honed with inquisitiveness, curiosity, integrity, presence.  It exists and is vast — infinitely more expansive than the mind’s ability to think.  

Find out the inner compass. Identify the feeling. Take notes. Collates.

**Speak to yourself in the third person**

When faced with a difficult problem one trick is to ask how you would view your choice in hindsight a year later. I'm able to make clearer judgments about situations, when someone else is going through them. It's much harder when I'm the subject of the story.  Your mental context is so much more developed when you're thinking about yourself (not in the 3rd person). You have skin in the game, maybe it's that you're worried about the outcome of the situation, or it's just stressing you out, or you're thinking about how it will affect your friends/family/the rest of your life. So when you view it from an outsider's perspective, and throw away all that mental "noise", you have a clearer head and can make better decisions with the long-term in mind.  Alternatively, if you're going through something, you could try imagining someone else in the same situation (make up someone if you have to). What advice would you give to them? Then use that advice for yourself.

**Imagine the difference between the idea of something the the reality of lived experience.** 

 There’s a different in having something and looking like we have the thing. Don’t mistake the map for the territory, else you’ll never be fulfilled. For example, the experience of actual programming something is quite different from the romantic vision of a hacker.  There’s a difference between what you like, and what you’d like to like, between love, and the idea of love, being aware, and being aware that you are aware.

For example: Living the life of a nomad travelling around the world seems enticing. But visualising yourself at awesome places is a fantasy where you usually leave out your own inner psychology: imagine as you are, right now. If you were transported to your dream vacation place, would you be happy?  Imagine the anxieties you will feel:  being jobless and aimless in life and not adding meaning to anyone else's, of not making a lasting impression etc.  Who would take care of Mom and Richa?

**Differentiate the feeling of lived experience from the memory of it**

Have life experiences and reflect on them, what you felt about them before and after so you can figure out the difference between the remembering experience and lived experience.

**Learn from other people’s lives**

Preemptively avoid the mistakes they made. Example: This is how I decided [against academia](/academia)

**Imagine the worst criticisms**

Does the things that can hold itself against the worst criticisims? Do you want to do it despite suffering?

**Find the intrinsic meaning**

Why is it meaningful?  Is it intrinsically meaningful, or are you doing it because of social validation? What is your benchmark for social proof - is it your immediate circle, national, or International? This has helped me decide against some of the opportunities I have walked away from: BRCA elections, Event Management, jobs in finance etc.

**Opportunity Costs**

What are you giving up? Life is tragic. 

For example, if I take up a prestigious career, what would I give up? Would I find time to pursue writing, or fitness, or date?  Missing out on all these, spending my free time debugging code or fixing excel sheets?

**Anticipation of regret**

In your old age, would you regret the time spent on that?

**Accept reality as a gift. You don't know anything.**

I was incredibly sad about joining Opera, but without Opera I would have never had the great friends I made at B202.

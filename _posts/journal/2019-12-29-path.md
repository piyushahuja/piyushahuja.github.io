**Find your inner compass**

Inner compass is different from thoughts, and it is different from the voice in your heads. The voice in your head is formed from beliefs, stereotypes, even language and habitual ways of thinking. Think of them as forces that have colonized humanity.

The inner compass is a feeling.  It feels free. It exists in the space and life beyond thoughts. Its honed with inquisitiveness, curiosity, integrity, presence.  It exists and is vast — infinitely more expansive than the mind’s ability to think.  

Find out the inner compass. Identify the feeling. Take notes. Collates.

**Speak to yourself in the third person**

When faced with a difficult problem one trick is to ask how you would view your choice in hindsight a year later. I'm able to make clearer judgments about situations, when someone else is going through them. It's much harder when I'm the subject of the story.  Your mental context is so much more developed when you're thinking about yourself (not in the 3rd person). You have skin in the game, maybe it's that you're worried about the outcome of the situation, or it's just stressing you out, or you're thinking about how it will affect your friends/family/the rest of your life. So when you view it from an outsider's perspective, and throw away all that mental "noise", you have a clearer head and can make better decisions with the long-term in mind.  Alternatively, if you're going through something, you could try imagining someone else in the same situation (make up someone if you have to). What advice would you give to them? Then use that advice for yourself.

**Imagine the difference between the idea of something the the reality of lived experience.** 

 There’s a different in having something and looking like we have the thing. Don’t mistake the map for the territory, else you’ll never be fulfilled. For example, the experience of actual programming something is quite different from the romantic vision of a hacker.  There’s a difference between what you like, and what you’d like to like, between love, and the idea of love, being aware, and being aware that you are aware.

For example: Living the life of a nomad travelling around the world seems enticing. But visualising yourself at awesome places is a fantasy where you usually leave out your own inner psychology: imagine as you are, right now. If you were transported to your dream vacation place, would you be happy?  Imagine the anxieties you will feel:  being jobless and aimless in life and not adding meaning to anyone else's, of not making a lasting impression etc.  Who would take care of Mom and Richa?

**Differentiate the feeling of lived experience from the memory of it**

Have life experiences and reflect on them, what you felt about them before and after so you can figure out the difference between the remembering experience and lived experience.

**What were the experiences of other people who followed this path?**

Preemptively avoid the mistakes they made. For example, his is how I decided [against academia](/academia)

**What are the worst criticisms of doing this?**

Does the things that can hold itself against the worst criticisims? Do you want to do it despite suffering? What flavor of shit sandwich would you like to eat?

**Is it intrinsically meaningful?**

Why is it meaningful?  Is it intrinsically meaningful, or are you doing it because of social validation? What is your benchmark for social proof - is it your immediate circle, national, or International? This has helped me decide against some of the opportunities I have walked away from: BRCA elections, Event Management, jobs in finance etc. 

---

**What are you giving up?**

Life is tragic, and there are opportunity costs.

For example, if I take up a prestigious career, what would I give up? Would I find time to pursue hobbies like writing, fitness, dating opportunities and family life?  Is missing out on all these for spending extra time debugging code or fixing excel sheets worth it?

**In your old age, would I regret the time spent on this?**

What is your legacy going to be? What are the stories people are going to tell when you’re gone? What is your obituary going to say? Is there anything to say at all? If not, what would you like it to say? How can you start working towards that today?

**Does this express who I am?** 

Do not think of the decision as being optimal, or even being right, but as an expression of identity.

**What's true about you that would make your 8-Year-Old Self cry?**


> The funny thing though, is that if my 8-year-old self asked my 20-year-old self, “Why don’t you write anymore?” and I replied, “Because I’m not good at it,” or “Because nobody would read what I write,” or “Because you can’t make money doing that,” not only would I have been completely wrong, but that eight-year-old-boy version of me would have probably started crying. That eight-year-old boy didn’t care about Google traffic or social media virality or book advances. He just wanted to play. And that’s where passion always begins: with a sense of play.

[Write in a decisison journal](https://www.fs.blog/2014/02/decision-journal/)

 The idea is whenever you are making a consequential decision, write down what you decided, why you decided as you did, what you expect to happen, and if you’re so inclined, how you feel mentally and physically. Writing itself makes you realize where there are holes in things. I'm never sure what I think until I see what I write. And so I believe that, even though you're an optimist, the analysis part of you kicks in when you sit down [to write] … You think, “Oh, that can't be right.” And you have to go back, and you have to rethink it all.

**Accept reality as a gift. You don't know anything.**

I was incredibly sad about my first job out of college - which was not my first choice, but by accepting it I walked into a gold mine of friendships that I still value.

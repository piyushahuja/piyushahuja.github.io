 and this is one of the ways a person
is more or less fully alive:  being, to their own feelings, sensations, lived experience, to the possibilities and capabilities of their self,  to the ebbs and flow of the world, to the unfolding present, to the mystery. Those who are are alive go through life as if it were a beautiful, harmonous dance, attuned to the music of the universe, improvised moment by moment.
And this is the closest one can get to enlightenment; maybe this is what enlightenment is.

Morality: 
Following the rule of integrity
amoralists (anything goes)
relativies


Second, more importantly, this journey of deepening of awareness can be made along many different aspects of human experience. One can develop a better awareness of language. Other can develop a better awareness of taste. But what other experience could you deepen your awareness of experience in? Listening? Seeing?  Breathing? Bodily comfort?  A moral sense? Intentions? Energy? Connection? Eros? Spirituality? In principle, it must be possible to always deepen awareness along any of thes lines. And every journey requires going inwards, deeper in touch with yourself, deeper into cultivating attention to all your feelings, sensations, inutition, and thoughts.

And the same pitfalls and dead-ends that I fell into - all the ways I thought I would get it - and didn't, befoe finally "getting it" would be present in that journey.

One misleading path that seem to be going towards "getting it", but actually takes one away from "it", to double down on the rules and principles with greater precision, as I did with the recipes. The rules, and the structure, the order, the rigidity, the clarity and stability and security it provides, is a trap. A dangerous mirage for the actual experience. 

This is the part of me that relates to friends who identify as neurodivergent. I suspect a similar psychology produces the obsessive compulsive behavior in people with OCD, or repetitive behavior in people on autism spectrum.[^neuro] I have often heard friends who identify with aspergers talk about their search for "the correct rules of behavior". They often find really good ones: some of them are very effective and apply to a wide set of circumstances, just like principles of good writing and cooking can produce fine literature and meals. Something like "say what you mean", "only speak what is true", "do what you say", "keep your promises and commitments". Another classic one is the Golden Rule: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Immanuel Kant[^Kant], in his moral theory,  found an even more sophisticated one: the categorical imperative, "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law". One of the painful struggles of Aspergers is that people seem to break rules all the time, just like one of the central struggles of following a recipe to the tee is when the food doens't turn out okay.  In all these cases, there is something that is prior to the rules: human experience, just like taste is prior to principles in writing or eating. It is not the case that humans generally follow rules of behavior, and every now and then end up violating them. Instead, they are following something completely different: their own reason, senses - including moral intuition, and complex mix of motivations, feelings (from fear to guilt to shame to pleasure and other things) and lived experience, indifferent to any rules and patterns that they seem to exhibit from the outset.

[^neuro]: I am aware that neurodivergence is said to be partly genetic, partly environmental, and not a purely psycholgical phenomenon. There might be biology at play. But the science on this is not as stable and powerful as Newtonion laws of nature are, for example, and even those were superceded by Einstein. Neuroscience and psychology is a nascent field and much is yet to be known, including how neuroplastic one is. So set that aside for a bit, will you? 

[^Kant]: I wouldnt' be surprised if Kant had Aspergers. For example, at precisely five in the afternoon, he would step out of his house and walk the exact same route of every other day of his life. This route is now known as “The Philosophers Walk”. Rumour has it that Kant only left his walking route twice in his life, one of those times to hear the scramble of news for the French Revolution. 


A second misleading path is to concentrate your attention, to focus your mind more and more, not on "the thing" - the missing experience, but on something else. In my case, it was the "whys" , the science and rational of each step of cooking. This is the part of me that relates to the hyperfocus aspect of ADHD. Once I hyperfocus my mind's attention an an aspect of human experience I did not previously attend to, I become an inveterate expert on the topic. The hyperfocus is a response to an absence of relaxed, abalnced attention; there is something that I did not attend to previously that hinders the flow of experience through me - in this particular example, taste - and, as a corrective, I hyperfocus on it.  If, instead of focussing my mind on all aspects of the experience, I were to just gradually bring into a slow relaxed awareness to where my sensation is (in this case, of taste) and stay with it, I would move away from what I experience as my ADHD part.

Third, the self-image that I was not one of those who could taste was a product of my mind. In seeking the answer in rationales and whys, I was looking for an answer within the realm of the mind. But the mind couldn't find the answer to something that was about something that transcends it: the senses. So what it produced was not an awareness based on the senses, but a self-image that was inaccurate. This, essentially diminishes the self, or the possibilities that lie therein.  If I had attended to what I liked and not liked, I would have had better self-awareness, from where in I could expand my sense of taste. Instead, the inaccurate self-image made me less aware of the actual truth.

There are other self-imaginings that the mind could produce: "I cannot do Maths", "I cannot dance", or, a common one, "I am not beautiful", or "I am not loved". Each of these dimishes your self-image in comparison to the actual self, and limits the possibilities instead of expanding them. I suspect that the extreme case is of narcissism, wherein the self-image has completely departed from the actual self. The self-image might be grandiose instead of diminished, but as long as it takes you from awareness of your actual self, it limits oneself from the possibility of actual growth. Narcissism to me feels like an instance of the misleading path in this journey where the is "hyperfocuses" is on the self-image and all that is required to sustain it (manipulation, objectification, craving-validation). 

The actual growth starts from meeting yourself where you are.  Don't have mathematical intuition? Could you count? Could you tell a square from a circle? That's a start.  Cannot dance? Can you move? Can you bounce, shake, wave your hands to music? That's a start.  You are not beautiful? You are not loved? Is there someone who finds you beautiful and loves you, or has done so in the past? Lets start from them: bring them into awareness. 

The dissolution of the mind's question, or the self-image, to a self-acceptance that starts from self-awareneness is the start of the journey to expanding your awareness, its possibilities and potentialities,  to achieve your fullest self expression.

The laws of nature can be said to be a similar attempt to navigate the extremely absurd, overwhelmingly complex nature of reality and the unfolding, flowing present, "What the fuck is going on?" 

To play music one must hear well, to draw one must learn to see well, to cook one must learn to taste well: all of these activities have in their basis a certain human experience; improving that experience is the proper end goal of that activity.

First, this potential for attunement, attention, awareness to one of our senses: taste is present in everyone. For it to be cultivated, one must start with paying attention to where they are currently, with deeper self-awareness. What do you like? What do you dislike? If you are unsure like I was, start with the basics and observe how your body responds. Surely you wouldn't eat everything that exists in the universe - a stone or a pile of poop? There must be something you find disgusting. There must be something that you find deeply pleasurable: maybe honey and fruits. Those could be starting points of our awareness. And then one can gradually going deeper and deeper. Sommeliers and professional tasters go through years of training. 





Perhaps this is the path to enlightenment.








[^love]: It is so with love. One can read all the books, listen to all the romantic songs, watch all the romantic movies, witness all their friends having the experience, but without the experience of being in love, can one ever know what love is?

This potential for more attunement, attention, awareness to one of our senses - taste - is present in everyone.  Sommeliers and professional tasters go through years of training.

A stone or a pile of poop, maybe? Similarly,  there must be something that you find deeply pleasurable: honey and fruits, maybe? Those could be starting points of our awareness. And then one can tune in more and more.

The same pitfalls and dead-ends that 


If one were to look to improve their writing without paying attention to language, they would be inclined to do look for some rules of good writing and mechanically follow them. If one were to improve their sense of taste in the absence of paying attention to their taste, they would eat food robotically, as fuel. If one were to improve their cooking in the absence of sight, smell or taste, they would robotically follow the recipes. In the absence of an experience, this is the best they can do. In all of these scenarios, the person does not get "it", they might not know that they do not "get it" - they might not be even aware that there is something to "get";  yet, from the outset, it might not look too different from those who "get it". 


The journey to "getting it": to get one's mind out of the way, to attend to your sensations, feelings, or intuitions, trusting them, and cultivating them, is not limited to eating and tasting, but extends far into every aspect of human life: drawing and seeing,  mathematical intuition, moral sense, energy and feelings, dating, desire and eros, connection and love,  justice and equality, dance and movement, religion, science and spirituality. 




Tuning in to your own bodily experience is the real meaning behind the pop wisdom like "be yourself" or "own your truth" or "say yes to yourself". It requires  attending to experience, deepening of awareness, and expanding the possibilities of the self. 


Its tuning in to the ebb and flow of life, to the music of the universe, a dance improvised moment-by-moment. Its what being fully alive is.

Why not to self improve? 
* Rooted in escapism and delusion (collapse of “the practice of living consciously”), “if I do this I will be happy” thinking, where you you sacrifice the present for some illusory, elusive future. 
* Rooted in self-rejection (collapse of “the practice of self acceptance”)), “I am not adequate” thinking, which plants an insecurity rather than a focus on your strengths; a mentality of scarcity rather than abundance, often supplemented by comparison, envy, jealousy, and anxiety from chasing unrealistic ideals and never being “good enough”
* For some goals, setting a goal IS the thing that ensures you don’t get to the goal (happiness, being yourself/authentic/real, etc. see Ted talk on How to win Rhodes for Dubai students, wooing a girl) (“the practice of living purposefully). Many desirable states — happiness, attractiveness, spontaneity — are best pursued indirectly, and conscious thought and effortful striving can actually interfere with their attainment. Trying not to try
* Compromise on Integrity (“the practice of integrity) , especially if pursuit of one goal contradicts with another. e.g.” I want to be good at writing cynical satire and ridicule those who believe X”, vs “I want to empathise and make people feel validated” for being charismatic. Dangers of role models: copying attributes can make you in authentic”. 
* Can turn into a charismatic sociopath (Ted Bundy, Donald Trump) dangers of narcissism
    * Lose real feelings (like guilt), authenticity, alienation from the self etc.
    * The hidden cost of manipulative behaviour is slow decline of respect for people, yourself and a distinct lack of empathy. Psychopaths are very good at reading people whereas despite being well read in human behaviour. Hacks are hacks, but ultimately if you are unable to respect people, you will inevitably lose respect.A true leader doesn’t need hacks. Never use strategies for manipulation. If you are really good with it it might work, but what is the damn point? And most of us aren’t really good if the reason is not genuine and authentic. We can all spot from a mile away when someone is trying to take something from us or sell us something. Even if we can’t put our finger on it exactly, we sense something is up. And then we are just waiting for the confirmation moment. “Aha! I knew it!”
* Is it possible to decide and be someone? To make a conscious choice “I’d be the, I’d be that”.  Whatever you little mind comes up with, will be too bare-bones, skeletal, analytical and limited. The world is expansive, abundant, changing, flowing, spontaneous. You can never capture it your little self-aware consciousness thoughts in your little minds. Which is what we mean by “be yourself”

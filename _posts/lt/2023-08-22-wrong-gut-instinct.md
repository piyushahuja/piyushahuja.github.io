They love me...they love me not.

By now I have a pretty good handle on the question. I don't have to pick the petals of a poor flower: my body could tell.

"*You sort of know...don't you"* said my friend Dawne. That you just *know* whether you'd hit it off with someone - pre-communication, pre-familiarity, pre- any dating rituals - was an idea that wafted through my skeptical mind - completely bypassed it - and struck a chord in the same area where the knowingness resided. It was true and I just knew it.

But have there been times when I sort of "just knew" that I am not loved, but eventually I was? When my gut instinct has been wrong?

This is my attempt to reflect on the times I've felt loved, or acutely felt the absence of it, and everything in between.

*Beatta*

The first signal was in the m/w reunion. I was looking at her, but she wasn't looking for me. And I was suddenly overcome by feeling of grief, with memories of all those times when I imagine being loved but the reality swerves differently. "She doesn't love me". "I'll never be loved"

Eventually, I sorted myself out and mustered the strength to meet her. When we hugged, she said, "you're my favourite Indian man here" (I was the only Indian).

She spent the closing with Simon.

At the parting, she mentioned she was going to meet "someone special".

I was her second pick. 

Seven months after that, we became lovers.

**How was my body wrong?**


I was overcome by grief. My mind said "I will never be loved". "This is just like every other time." "My body knows" 

But the truth is: she did like me. Its just that I wasn't her desire at that time: I was her safety. But months later, eventually, we did become lovers.

What did I do right? I accepted her truth. I never tried to get. I didn't come on too strongly. I kept in touch. I kept my heart open. But she was good to me, too - that made it easier.

*Sarah*

She spent the closing with Simon.

But the next morning, she sat next to me.

She wasn't nervous talking to me, "we have to say goodbye don't we".

Towards the end, she offered me a lift.

I sent her a love letter.

She responded immediately, but demured.

A few months after that, we spoke on phone. She wasn't shy or nervous or anxious - I was. She was funny and confident.

A few months after that, I dropped her a voice note, offering to visit. She had a week to think about it - and then she invited me.

I didn't think she would - I was wrong - but she did. 

We spoke on the way. She spoke lovingly and sent me flirtatious messages. This is what being loved looks like, feels like. I was welcome.

And we became lovers.

**How was my body wrong?**

At the closing I was overcome by grief. Thoughts of never being loved "I will be forever alone" rocked my system.

But that's an overreaction. She did like me. At the time, she was just looking out for herself: what was right for her. It was a matter of time.

*Becky* 


When I joined her at the breakfast table, she looked at the clock, and left.

In her ceremony, I interpreted my role to be a restricted one, though "I do like your touch, you know that, right?

"I would have loved to have picked him" - on me being a wild card


**How was I wrong?**

I was hypersensitive to signals that I am not desired, and when they were not present, I had a strong negative feeling arise in me. What was the feeling? Resentment, anger,  a feeling of someone exercising control over me, or "showing me my place", or being disgusted by me. But these were thoughts of my mind, I felt disgust for myself, I felt unworthy.

At the end of the ceremony, Becks wanted us to cuddle. She sent me a message and in the subsequently, greatly desired intimacy and connection, more so than me!

*Francesca*


She invited me to join her group.

At the yes/no touch meetings, she was the one who came back.

She stayed after everyone left at the beach.

She picked me for the ceremony.

She has been clear and direct. 

This is what being loved looks like in the strongest form.

**How was I wrong?**

But I still found reasons to not trust her...

That she approached other assistants. 
That maybe she is rescuing me

But how much more could she do?

She event went on to be strategic about me at LT3.
She is public about how I help her

*Charity*

Did I sort of "know"?

Came to me at soft space, explaining what she had wanted.

So there was a liking, at least, if not outright desire.

Not until the circumstances turned me into hero.

In the exercise with Sophie, was present and attuned.

She sees me as a "clean, masculine" energy, full of integrity.

**Memories of being loved**

- Ginta bringing me food, waving at the Zoom screen, picking me as my husband, finding me at the bath, speaking respectfully at the island and in the eulogy.
- Debbie chosing me, and then choosing me again. Her picking apart my self-criticism, affirmations on my performance.
- Francesca referring to my comment "Warrior Women" publicly, mentioning to Mags that she had a good intimacy session. 
- Clare: sending me that long email after LT1
- Sophie: in islands. 
- Sarah
- Becky
- Charity "clean, masculine energy", coming to me in islands
- Sammie chosing me in Radically Honesty Dating
- Charlotte Facherty meeting me twice

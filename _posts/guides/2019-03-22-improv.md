# Practice Games

Napier's framework of improvisation: throw out the "rules of improvisation", and instead focus on following one's instincts.  The trick is to practice like crazy and then let go and surrender into the present-moment. You have to learn how to let your soft animal body take over and channel all that goodness automagically through a fresh pipe. 


Don't prepare 
* Give up planning. Drop the habit of thinking ahead. Stockpiling ideas for future use is unnecessary.
* Attend carefully to what is happening right now.
    * Do not focus on things outside your control.  The solution to being better at focusing on the here-and-now doesn't come from directly thinking "I must focus on now" but instead comes from training yourself to not worry and obsess about things beyond your control. [This is why I have had problems on delegating tasks when QC Secy or when selecting UC team: I would worry about things outside my control.]
* Allow yourself to be surprised.
* Trust your imagination. There is always something in the box.
* Welcome whatever floats into your mind.
* Fear is a matter of misplaced attention. Focus on redirecting it.

**Play: Word association** 

Think of a random word, and have a friend do the same. On the count of three, both of you say the word you are thinking of, at the same time. Count to three again, and this time both of you try to say a word that is somehow between the two words you said in the first round. Continue doing this, with the goal of eventually both saying the same word. This will strengthen your ability to draw connections between things that are not obviously related.

 Free associate one thought with another: go and explore wherever they take you*
Caution: Don't do this at job interviews, where structured communication is key. 

As you go about your life, associate like crazy. Let your mind and imagination run wild and free. If you see an interesting object, start word-associating with it. 
Seeing a pretty flower might make you think of a vineyard, and then Jack and the Beanstalk, then geese, then Ryan Gosling, etc etc. Make those associations quick and snappy and try to see how far away from the original object you can get.

Add details.

**Write and speak a lot every day. Everytime you speak, do it boldly and clearly.** 


To get better at generating streams of words, you need to practice generating streams of words. 


Being able to say the first thing that comes to mind when you’re onstage is invaluable!


------


**Start a conversation with a random person on a bus or other means of public transport.**

Conversational skills are very important in improvisational theatre as you will find yourself in different scenes where you'll have to make your character more believable + you never know what crazy stuff your fellow bus rider has to offer, from settings to characters and situations.

-----

**Write every morning**, and I usually have a least one period of social time every day. 

Once you have stable and good quality content, you can **work on tuning the details of how it’s delivered.** You can work on tone, and inflection, and timing. You can tease-out that pause before the punchline while making eye contact with someone in the audience. You can slow down, stand up tall, and survey the crowd. You can breathe deeply and soften down into your legs so that your consciousness fills your body and the room, so that you can enthrall and delight the audience, so that you can entice them into your world and entertain them like royalty in your palace of presence.

------



**Do Voiceovers**  

Go to a public place and watch two people having a conversation. Perform a "voiceover" in your head of what they might be saying, giving different voices for the two characters.  Watch vox pop videos on youtube and try to imitate normal people. Observe animals when they do animal stuff. Cut the sound on a movie and try to voice over. Do it with with a wildlife documentary.

----

**Practice a new accent, Figure out how you talk - quietly, singing, loud, screaming, questioning. Stop talking high pitched through the nose, clear airways, breathe.**

Practice Sentences and Paragraphs with Audio Recorders - Use audio editors such as Audacity (Free Audio Editor and Recorder) and Practice 15 - 30 minutes a day until your general speech habits improve. Place emphasis on words, sentences, and paragraphs that are most difficult for you to articulate. Repeat certain sentences and paragraphs until they soundto pleasant 

----

**Imitate the Most Articulate Celebrities and Public Figures**

Do your best impressions of highly articulate and successful talk show hosts, news anchors, radio hosts, actors, voice actors, etc. This is a great way to invoke benchmarks that you can use as comparisons to your own voice habits and articulation level. 

Visualize Yourself Speaking Well on National Television and in Front of Large Crowds - Believe it or not, your unsatisfactory speaking habits and articulation may be rooted in the fear of being the center of attention and embarrassing yourself. Your lack of articulation could result from tension and a certain level of social anxiety that result from your own thoughts and perceptions. Picture yourself talking in situations that you think are well out of your league, and you'll start to develop the peace of mind and confidence to articulate your speech carefully in situations that would normally intimidate you. 

---


When you are out and about, **watch people,  how they behave when they are on their own, how they relate in a group, how they get each other attention.** Notice when it is that people actually have a conversation and when it is that they just take it in turn to brag. 

Being in the moment A great improviser lives in the here and now, in the present. He is alert and is able to respond instantly and sharply to changes or sudden twists and turns. This means that all sorts of other thoughts do not distract him, but that he is totally focused on things that are happening around him at that particular moment in time. By being in the present, and not judging the situation, all options are open and everything is possible.  

**Life *is* attention. Notice everything, particularly the details.** Become a detective. Shift your attention from yourself to others.  Make an effort to remember names and faces. Keep on waking up.  This moment only happens once. Treasure it. Avoid multitasking. Attend to one thing at a time. Don't prepare  Give up planning.   Attend carefully to what is happening right now. Allow yourself to be surprised.  Welcome whatever floats into your mind. Fear is a matter of misplaced attention. Focus on redirecting it.

Start with a concept, like seeing a disheveled-looking man ordering a coffee at Starbucks, and build up a story and a life around him. Create a history for him and plan a future. Ask yourself what his family is like, what he does for a living, what he does for fun, etc. If you notice something suitable for world-building, like two squirrels coming out of a tree, construct a fictional universe for them to live in. How are these squirrels related? What’s their language? Is the tree their house? Their place of work? Do they interact with other animals or are squirrels the only sentient animals in this world? Ask yourself world-building questions and then answer them.

**Play: Come up with random objects, list their uses. Then connect them**

Grab a pen, some paper and a timing device. In a few minutes time per subject, come up with as many uses as possible for the following objects (think of five random, unrelated nouns):
* A Brick
* One shoe
* A Rope
* A Tape measure
* A Stereo Speaker

Here's a quick example by Max Matterson:
- Pencil might give you: lead, words, sentence, write, sharpen, draw, pictures
- Judges could give you: sentence court, wig, life, oath, right 
- What links these two things together? You might say wright(right) and sentence... Now put them together in a joke:
- In what way are pencils and judges the same? They pass sentences, always have the last word and are wright all the time

 
- Take any two concepts:
	- Eye Trouble: Lazy eyes, tearing, cross eyed, can’t see well, have trouble reading, need glasses, world looks funny or different.
	- Dyslexia: Have trouble reading, letters and numbers look funny or different, can’t read well, can’t read quickly, have trouble concentrating.
	- These are just a couple examples thrown together in a hurry to give you the idea. Obviously there are lots of other associations we might make from these, and yet we can already see that there are some pretty useful links between the two. So all we need to do is to make these links by applying a bit of lateral thinking and then presto. You have a quick joke like...
If you are cross eyed and dyslexic, does that mean that you can see perfectly?

Example: What’s the connection between a skeleton and a bar? 
A skeleton asks a barman for a pint of beer and a mop.

There is no connection between the two except that we recognize when the skeleton drinks there is nowhere for the liquid to go except the floor. What makes it funny is that the skeleton is unable to drink but wasting his money and good beer.



Play with someone:
With a friend, brainstorm a list of random objects. Write each one down on a piece of paper, fold them up, and put them in a bowl. Draw a piece of paper at random, and set a timer for 1 minute. Come up with as many uses for that object as you can before the timer goes off. Read them aloud, crossing out the uses that the other person also listed. Whoever has the longest list at the end of this process wins.

**Anthropomorphize everything and develop personalities for them.** I find this is easiest to do with cars because their front grills are very expressive faces and their bodywork lends them a good personality. I think of BMWs as snooty french men (because of the moustache) and then the the different models of BMWs have different personalities. One thing that humans really have going for us is that we see humanity all around us. We are trained to spot faces wherever we look, like in the front grill of a car or an electrical socket. Where there is a face, there is a character.

**Character relay: start a timer that beeps every 30 seconds and then, for that 30 seconds, begin a character monologue.** There is no prompt. In fact, as much as you can, avoid preplanning any of the characters, or even thinking about the exercise. Jump right into the improvisation, and say whatever is on your mind. This is the point of the exercise.  After those 30 seconds have elapsed, instantly jump to a new character. Ideally, make it as different as possible from your previous character. Do the monologue for 30 seconds, repeat. This continues for as long as you like-- I've only done it for about 20 minutes at a time, but Napier (the author) claims to have put people through the ringer for an entire hour at a time.
	- For example: Pretend to be a crotchety, 90 year old woman for 5 minutes. Practice her voice, stance, feelings, actions and reactions. 
	- Great! Now do the same for a toddler, a stuffy English butler, a hyperactive dog, a stoned west-coast surfer, etc. etc. etc. Create different characters by playing with the way you walk, talk, move, and improvise (out loud) monologues.

Set a clock for 10 minutes. Start with a character monologue. After no more than 60 seconds, you should slip into a two character scene with that character. From there, keep "cutting to" or wiping to related scenes, flashbacks, flashforwards, or completely new scenes. The two goals are a) to improvise nonstop for 10 minutes and b) to create as many characters and situations in 10 minutes as possible. Do one of these as a practice, and then do one for real. Let yourself be creative in your "cut-to" situations. This exercise strengthens an improvisor's sense of responsibility onstage - you quickly learn that you can't bail on a scene or check out mentally! It also builds your confidence, playfulness and your facility in being able to play and heighten a moment in a long form.

**Do Solo Three Line Scenes**

These will feel strange at first, but it's a great exercise to add to your warm-ups, as it gets your brain moving and gets you to commit fully to a range of characters. 

- In character, initiate a scene with an opening line. 
- Then, changing your physicality and even your physical position, Immediately switch to a contrasting character - the larger the contrast, the better, and deliver the second line of the scene. 
- Then, move back into the original position, physicality and attitude of the first character and deliver the third line of the scene. 

For the first few of these, start off being easy on yourself, then tighten up the scenes. Focus on getting out the who, what and where in those scant three lines. Work through negative and dismissive responses until you are only giving yourself positive agreements with each three-line scene. Push your range of characters and your range of contrasts - you should keep doing these until you are well beyond your stock characters.


Solo Two Character Scenes/three character scenes .
Once you have warmed up with three line scenes, slow down and try an extended two-character scene. 
Focus on giving gifts to yourself - "Rosemary, your pale gauntness is delicious!" 

Let these go a little long so that you can explore the possibilities of being the sole driver of a scene. As you slip between characters, let yourself be physically neutral. Take care to keep the characters' physicalities distinct. After a couple of these, challenge yourself to try three character and group scenes.

**Grab any postcard or photo or picture at random, and proceed to articulate in detail, preferably in a loud voice, what's in the picture**

Whats the theme/what's in the foreground/what's in the background/what's in the centre or middle/what's on the right/what's on the left/what's at the top/what's at the bottom/what at the top-right/top-left/bottom-right/bottom-left/what's happening/is it inside or outside/who's there/how's the weather and/or timing; how do you know/compare and contrast/how do you feel/what do you like/what do you dislike/would you like to be in the postcard or photo or picture; why and why not?

**Play: Given random settings and objects, create a story**

Get 10 index cards.  Write one object on each of them.  Anything.  You can write "flowers" on one and "Belgian waffle" on another.  Now take a few moments to write five settings on a sheet of paper.  Examples can include: "ballroom dancing class," "hostage negotiation," "brewery tour."

Shuffle your cards.  Pull two out and put them face up in front of you.  Create a  story involving these two items in the first setting that you listed.  It doesn't have to be humorous at first, just plausible.  As you keep going, you can try to make it humorous.  Repeat until you complete the set.  Reshuffle.  Repeat.  Make it funnier each time.

**Practice it in A-B storytelling games**

- A produces a bunch of material
- B connects them

Object Work,Physical Movement and MimingGestures and Facial ExpressionsTones and AccentsEmotions

Avoid Cartooning: Prioritie physicality (show winters by your behavior rather than tell its winter, if you are siblings get an energy (protective, nurturing vs competitive, sparring) into the relationship), Prioritize emotions (what do the rich details and idea make you feel? Excited or stressed? Happy or Sad?), Bring only one brick rather than the whole whole (one brick with one or two strong details. (instead of the folly of trying to control too much, for fear of unexpected directions or confusion)), give partners a chance to add to the scene (instead of generously getting the basic details out of the way, give a chance to the teammate to meaningfully contribute)


Story: Fortunately, Unfortunately. Discovery, not Erasure, Active listening + randomization, small increments, forward momentum towards a certain goal/resolutionhttps://improvdr.com/2020/12/25/game-library-fortunately-unfortunately/
Teaches: Pacing, Skill of being able to gently make matters worse or better, gradually building momentum

 CROW (Character, Relationship, Objective and Where) or the related acronym WWW (Who, What and Where). When these details are crafted with care and love during the opening of a scene, improvisers are more likely to have a strong and nuanced base from which to build their creative journeys

break routines, raise the stakes, or increase the heat

Confessions: (secrets) Own your confession fully to yourself ("I said something vulgar" vs "Your dad said something vulgar"), Give it time and space, feel the emotional weight (don't explain away in lie of breath and feeling emotions, better when they change onstage relationships or throw light on pre-established facts or reuse shelved materials.Accusation: hiding, obscuring, or evading. creates tension or juxtaposition with known details, allow relionship/status to change, avoid counter accusation, rationalization and justification of the accusation (let the accusation land)Discover: Set it up. If someone has broken into the cabin, designate and embellish the features of a particular broken window. specificity breeds specificity. Make it important. discovery will typically start out as an environmental, costume or prop choice. most helpful and effective when it connects to or complicates the current relationships. discovery reveals about them or their motivations.  emerge organically from the previously established given circumstances. specific location:  it is significantly more difficult to discover an object or facet of the environment that can ramp up the dynamism of a scene if you are performing in a “nowhere” on an essentially empty stage. The more you craft an interesting location with a wide array of props and furniture pieces, the more you will ultimately have at your disposal to inspire a scenic revelation of note.

Game LibraryAccusation (reveal something about the character or past actions): 1. Mine previous details and fit with it,  It can be dynamic to craft an accusation in such a way that creates tension or juxtaposition with known details – the model straight “A” student has some skeletons in their closet – but be cautious of making a revelation that undermines a played reality2.  seek accusations that affect your character perosnally Accusations should have influence on the status quo of the current relationship
 upset the pre-established power or status dynamics at play. The accusation should shift how the characters view each other. On deeper levels, it’s also likely to adjust status relationships and probably who even has the power in the scene or relationship. This holds true whether the accusation is “negative” (“You stole the answers”) or “positive” (“I know you told Chelsea that you want to kiss me”).
3. let it land and dont return in kind and allow the relationship to shift.https://improvdr.com/2020/09/25/game-library-point-counterpoint/

- How to build context: Character- Location- Situation- Status- Mood/Emotion-Prop-Attitude to the world-Accent- Movement (Sitting/Standing etc.)- Any Structure helps: (Begin with the next letter...etc.)- Build slowly, one small detail at a time- Thumbrules: Yes, And, If this is true, what else is true?- Active listening


Game previously:Fortunately/UnfortunatelyHalf lifeStructure: 
Game: 
- think of Character, think of animal embodied, think of attitude to the world, and do the scene- Half life- Endowments- previously- Sitting/standing/lying

Accents:
Example:Obsessed with smell/Fishes/EmbroidersDoes a dance after every sentenceGoes through every emotion before saying
Character can be formed by: want, motivation(good/bad/neutral), one childhood memory that defined them (always being the star of the school play, really wanting to do karate, always doing other people's homework, being in a movie). And then expressed differently based on whom they meet: a boss, an audience, an audience where one of the members is a crush etc...Games: 
15 minute themed long form: Murder mystery. Take prompts from audience- location, murder weapen, random props (a piece of cloth! an object!), title


Bring little sweets, something quirky - just to make it a talking point. Share a skill - bring ropes, shibari (tie someone up), featherologist, vampire gloves, fake tattoors, aphorodisiact perfume - anything cute/interactive

# Breathing


Breathing correctly means you are efficiently producing tone, using your diaphragm muscles properly, phrasing your lines well, and turning your entire body into an instrument.  To do this consistently, you may need to learn a lot of physical adjustments to make in order to get to the point where you're breathing effortlessly and producing tone.  "An expert keeps trying until he gets it right.  A master keeps trying until he can't get it wrong." 

- Wrong: Stand in front of a mirror and take a quick, deep breath in. Did you notice your shoulders shrug upward when you did that? 

- Wrong: Stand tall and shrug your shoulders up toward your ears. Hold that position and take a deep breath. Or, rather, try to take a deep breath. You can’t do it. You can take in some air, but not a lot, and what you can take in sounds labored. There’s a big whooshing sound that just doesn’t feel right. It feels weak.

- Wrong: Hunch over at the thoracic spine. Imagine you’re typing away at the computer and let your chest cave in, your shoulder blades spread out, and your head droop forward. In other words, give yourself the type of terrible posture that millions of us sport each day. Hold that position and try to take a deep breath. It’s belabored, right?

- Wrong: Suck in your gut. Flex those abs and flatten that belly. Inhale, and note how thin and ineffectual your breathing sounds and feels. Your diaphragm is pinned against your contracted abdominal muscles. It can’t go anywhere. It can’t do anything, and your breathing suffers for it.

- **Inhale**
    - Breath from your diaphragm - this will give you better tone and control, and will allow you to sing for longer without having to take another breath.
    - Lying down or standing up. Relax and focus on the movement of the diaphragm. Place your hands or lay a book with reasonable heft on your belly (this will give you something to brace against).
    -  Take a deep breath and let your belly expand as your diaphragm asserts itself. When done correctly, you will see your stomach pop out a bit when you intake air.  Your chest and shoulders may rise and your ribs may expand, but this is totally normal and expected as long as the belly moves first. 
    - Try to get the highest ratio of movement to effort in your ribs and abdominals (i.e. without a great feeling of exertion, feel a great deal of expansion in these areas). 
    - Limit movement in the shoulders. 
    - Three Seconds [Stronger Lungs For Coronavirus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwLzAdriec0&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR1mwJz5IgIaByj8kg54CQ38sxBB0N44ca1x1rfyVOlaMZA5Hyr_2-KLjPo)

- **Exhale**
    -  Make sure you're not holding your breath
    -  Make sure you don't feel a lot of supraglottal pressure building up (this would feel like you're lifting something heavy)
    -  Make sure your ribs and abdominal muscles feel relaxed and free. 
    -  Slowly exhale while tightening your core and contracting your abs. As the abdominal muscles contract, they’ll push the diaphragm back up. This will reduce the volume of the thoracic cavity, increase the air pressure, and expel the air contained therein. Continue to take deep diaphragmatic breaths for a couple minutes. Inhale three seconds, exhale six to ten seconds.
    - Six Seconds

**Terms**

- **Sing scales**, learn all the **modes**, not just the classical ones. If you're looking to expand your range, work those scales. Singing "ah," (remember to open wide and do it so that you feel like you're yawning) is the most effective way to run scales because it will force you to open up your throat and expand that range. Try to get just a half a step higher each day. You won't see immediate improvement here, but if you keep after this every day, you'll notice that you can easily go up an additional 2-3 whole **notes** (NOTE: doing this WHILE practicing diaphragm breathing will help you see progress much quicker).. Learn some classical pieces, these help you develop a rich tone and well rounded voice. In general, the more classical the style you're going for, the more careful you're going to have to be with your voice. That means pushing much more rarely and delicately. In general, you should start singing classical, then layer style on top of your cultivated technique.


- **Melody** A melody (from Greek "singing, chanting"), also tune, voice, or line, is a linear succession of musical tones that the listener perceives as a single entity. In its most literal sense, a melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm, while more figuratively, the term can include successions of other musical elements such as tonal color. 

- **Prosody**: It is the study of the patterns of rhythm and sound used in poetry. The patterns of stress and intonation in a language. These contribute to linguistic functions such as intonation, tone, stress, and rhythm. Prosody may reflect various features of the speaker or the utterance: the emotional state of the speaker; the form of the utterance (statement, question, or command); the presence of irony or sarcasm; emphasis, contrast, and focus; or other elements of language that may not be encoded by grammar or by choice of vocabulary. 
There is no agreed number of prosodic variables. In auditory terms, the major variables are:

    * the pitch of the voice (varying between low and high)
    * length of sounds (varying between short and long)
    * loudness, or prominence (varying between soft and loud)
    * timbre or voice quality (quality of sound)

- **Rhythm**: e.g. The repeated pattern of stress and unstressed syllables in a sentence

- **Cadence** A unit of pitch variation. In music, a cadence is a melodic or harmonic configuration that creates a sense of resolution. A rhythmical effect in written text. 'the dry cadences of the essay' The cadence of someone's voice is the way their voice gets higher and lower as they speak. 

- **Intonation** the rise and fall of the voice in speaking. Intonation is variation of spoken pitch that is not used to distinguish words; instead it is used for a range of functions such as indicating the attitudes and emotions of the speaker, **signalling the difference between statements and questions**, and between different types of questions, **focusing attention on important elements of the spoken message** (e.g. Take *Mel* to the theatre. The **stress** on Mel changes the pitch pattern (i.e. the intonation) of the sentence ) and also helping to regulate conversational interaction. 
Some writers have described intonation entirely in terms of pitch, while others propose that what is referred to as intonation is in fact an amalgam of several prosodic variables
    * The division of speech into units
    * The highlighting of particular words and syllables
    * The choice of pitch movement (e.g. fall or rise)
These are sometimes known as tonality, tonicity and tone 

- **Tone** (or Mood)
  Intonation contrasts with tone, in which pitch variation in some languages distinguishes words, either lexically or grammatically.  Tone is the use of pitch in language to distinguish lexical or grammatical meaning,  that is, to distinguish or to inflect words. All verbal languages use pitch to express emotional and other paralinguistic information and to convey emphasis, contrast, and other such features in what is called intonation, but not all languages use tones to distinguish words or their inflections, analogously to consonants and vowels. Languages that do have this feature are called tonal languages; the distinctive tone patterns of such a language are sometimes called tonemes, by analogy with phoneme. Tonal languages are extremely common in Africa, East Asia, and Central America, but rare elsewhere in Asia and in Europe; as many as seventy percent of world languages may be tonal.

- **Stress**

    * pitch prominence, that is, a pitch level that is different from that of neighbouring syllables, or a pitch movement
    * increased length (duration)
    * increased loudness (dynamics)
    * differences in timbre: in English and some other languages, stress is associated with aspects of vowel quality (whose acoustic correlate is the formant frequencies or spectrum of the vowel). Unstressed vowels tend to be centralized relative to stressed vowels, which are normally more peripheral in quality

- **Pitch**

- **Tempo**: Try to vary it: speak fast, pause, speak slow etc. Pauses are essentially: the best speakers are not those who get the most words out, but whose words get listened to (or processed) the most.

- **Loudness or Volume**

- **Texture**

- **Timbre** (the quality that makes one sound different from another based on sound production): think of same note being played by different instruments

- **Resonance** how the sound vibrates in different cavities: oral, nasal, pharyngeal etc.

- **Expressiveness and Range**

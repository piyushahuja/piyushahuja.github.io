> Certainly this man, notwithstanding his youth, understands the improvisation of life, and astonishes even the acutest observers. For it seems that he never makes a mistake, although he constantly plays the most hazardous games. One is reminded of the improvising masters of the musical art, to whom even the listeners would fain ascribe a divine infallibility of the hand, notwithstanding that they now and then make a mistake, as every mortal is liable to do. But they are skilled and inventive, and always ready in a moment to arrange into the structure of the score the most accidental tone (where the jerk of a finger or a humor brings it about), and to animate the accident with a fine meaning and soul. 

> Here is quite a different man: everything that he intends and plans fails with him in the long run.  That on which he has now and again set his heart has already brought him several times to the abyss, and to the very verge of ruin; and if he has as yet got out of the scrape, it certainly has not been merely with a "black eye."  Do you think he is unhappy over it?  He resolved long ago not to regard his own wishes and plans as of so much importance.  "If this does not succeed with me," he says to himself, "perhaps that will succeed; and on the whole I do not know but that I am under more obligation to thank my failures than any of my successes.  Am I made to be headstrong, and to wear the bull's horns?  That which constitutes the worth and the sum of life for me, lies somewhere else; I know more of life, because I have been so often on the point of losing it; and just on that account I have more of life than any of you!"

**What is charisma?**

- the ability to make people feel good about themselves
- the ability to make people feel special
- the aura of infallibility, "couldn't be wrong, couldn't lose, couldn't fail, if i'm with him i'll be okay", "in control and knows what he's saying and wouldn't let things go wrong"
- to inspire devotion 
- the quality of magnetism, being someone that others are "drawn to"
- strength of personality
- alluring, bewitching, captivating, fascinating, charming, enchanting, engaging, magnetic and seductive.

**Who has charisma?**


- [Bill Clinton](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Bill-Clinton-like-in-person)
- Barack Obama
- Helena Mika
- [Emma Stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kFPrxfA8x0)
    *  She doesn’t shy from talking about her failings or insecurities or about herself, but when she does it she does in a completely confident “I love myself anyway” way. 
- [Cate Blanchett](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAXE5fJQu1Q)
-  Stever Jobs
-  Julius Caesar (story on how he quelled a mutiny: sudden appearance on the dias, unhesitating decision, dramatic silence, forgiving generously, harsh insult)

> My younger sister was voted high school class president without running, because she had known and helped pretty much everyone in her class already. She became her sorority's Pledge Mom for similar reasons - no one could imagine anyone else having the role. She's a down-to-earth conflict resolver, and becomes the voice of reason, organizer, and trustworthy person to confide with or have a deep discussion with to any group she joins - her friends, her classes, her sorority. She's extremely level-headed, knows exactly which friends to vent her stress to, and charms everyone she meets. Her emotional intelligence is off the charts, and can always be counted on to think before she speaks.

**How to become Charismatic?**

- [Absolutely love your Being](/yourself)
- Connect with others and love their being. Give each person your undivided attention
- Try to see people as they see themselves
    - Listen to understand. See things from other people's point of view. 
    - Find out what they care about, who they want to be and where they want to go. Try to either help them or redirect them to someone who can 
    *  Radical acceptance. 
        *  Completely accept people around me. Shit happens in people's lives and judging them doesn't make it better for anybody.  Have random conversations with strangers where they tell me some of their passions, secrets and life goals because I open the floor without judgment. 
        * [Stoic suspension of judgement](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18588727)
        * [How to be polite](https://medium.com/s/story/how-to-be-polite-9bf1e69e888c)
    - Be in tune with their emotions
    - Express what they feel in a more eloquent way
- [Tell stories](/storytelling)
- [Swim in language](/wit)
- Be emotionally expressive
- Enjoy
- [Be grateful](/gratitude)

**Help people to generate altruistic energy and self-respect**

- Being at the centre of networks engaged in major social transformation is a formula for generating a huge amoung of emotional energy in yourself! If you can focus it and keep it flowing, you become charismatic.

- Charismatic people get their energy off dynamic people and avoid energy drainers "bozos"

------


**Be joyful**

* Dress only in What Sparks Joy
* Entertain yourself, not others . Do things to amuse yourself. Never be bored.

> I learned this lesson from my brother. He always laughs about the stupidest shit. It could be a gif depicting a squirrel falling from a tree, or funny lyrics, or a fart – his sense of humor is what you could call simple. The point is, he is constantly entertaining himself. Himself is key because he doesn’t do it for others. Everyone is welcome to join him and see what’s so funny, but he doesn’t try to make others laugh. If they do, cool. If not, then he has fun on his own.
> By doing that others get drawn to him, and become curious why he has so much fun. Everyone wants to be around fun people. It adds value to their lives. Trust me, no one ever forgets the guy who made them laugh. But everyone forgets (or at least avoids) the clown who tried to be funny for two hours.

- Being interesting is about making the world around you interesting. People who are funny are usually depressed; their continuous desperate attempts to make the world around them interesting being the source of their humour.  

- You become charismatic not by doing interesting things, but by making things you do interesting. Not by a checklist, but by being so present that you extract so much more meaning from a simple thing.  Everything about your life is so interesting! Like every stupid little thing. And when you talk you make it interesting by virtue of the fact that you believe it is interesting (even though it is objectively boring). Because that you X is interesting is an immutable fact and then you change your performance and perception to make it interesting so that you can live with that fact.

- You have to be interesting to yourself. All those spontaneous thoughts, the ones which you think are obvious and trivial and meaningless, are only obvious and trivial and meaningless to you; the other person hasn’t thought them, they don’t know what you know, what is clear as daylight to you is an interesting insight to them. So speak up, put your thoughts out there, weave stories and arguments with conviction and confidence and don’t back down in the face of pressure or lack of reaction.

 Believe you are interesting.

**Be grateful.**



> "I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.”


- Be like Heidi. 
- Treasure the details.
- Make a point of thanking those with thankless jobs. Who or what is helping you right now?   What are you doing to give back? Keep the gift moving forward.  Our smallest actions count. Everything we do has the potential to help others. Compliment strangers if you feel like it. And feel like it! Make "thank you" your mantra. 

* It is possible to be honest and positive 100% of the time. 
    * Cultivate Positive Phrases. Phrases like "You bet", "Well played", "Good idea.", "Fair enough." Exercise the yes muscle. This builds optimism and hope.  Look for the positive spin, for what is right.
    * Replace "I do not have time" with "I have other things in the priority order". 
    * Replace "You cannot afford this” with “The price I want to offer this in the market would not be attractive to you”. 
    * "I do not know how to do this" with "I feel X would have the Comparative Advantage in this" 
    * Just say yes.
    * Hold a "can do" attitude
    *  Agree with those around you.
    *  Substitute "Yes *and*" for "Yes *but*." Add something to build the conversation.


- Note how often, if ever, you shoot other peoples' ideas down. 


----

**Leverage your strengths.**

If more people would just focus on taking advantage of their strengths, on focusing to expand themselves to the highest level instead of trying to patch their weakness they would be much more happier and ahead in life. Instead of focusing on your lacks, on what you are missing and feeling like you are never. Your weaknesses are there for a reason, to steer you towards your greatness. The moment you accept them, you accentuate your strengths and your life goes on the offense.

Everyone is better at some things than others. Define yourself by your strengths, not your weaknesses. Acknowledge your weaknesses and figure out how to work around them, but don’t let them stop you from doing what you want to do. “I can’t do X because I’m not good at Y” is something I hear from entrepreneurs surprisingly often, and almost always reflects a lack of creativity. 


-----



**Be at the cause, not at the effect .**

Instead of always reacting from your environment and from the triggers that other people give you, set the rhythm of how you want to live your life. Stop asking for permission from others to be great and to do the things that bring you joy because your happiness will always be dictated by other factors out of your control. You will be at the effect of various circumstances. When you choose to stand by your values and your core beliefs, when you are congruent in your thoughts and actions you will set the rhythm and the effect for everything happening around you, like ripples in water. When you are the cause, nothing can phase you, because everything you do and feel becomes a choice. In return you spread value to everyone around you

---

**Start thinking of your life as a gift you can give to others.**



---


**Make Others Look Good**

A good improviser is very altruistic by nature. One of the ground rules of improv is: make sure the other person looks good. When you watch two improvisers on stage, you can easily see this habit at work. They do not try to outshine the other person. Instead, they make strong choices that set others up for success. What choices do you make as a leader that sets other up for success? Gush Over People. Make them feel and look good. People will forget what you said, but they’d remember how you made them feel. Make People Feel Good. Leave conversation partners better than they were before you entered. (When you talk ill of someone, people associate those ills with you). Trigger emotions: Make them laugh, Really listen to problems and dreams, huG longer,  Don’t take yourself too seriously. Use fewer words and easier sentences but express them with more emotion. * Be unexpectedly helpful and courteous. Tell stories

---

**Live Assertively**

Speak your mind. Have an opinion, even if it might piss some people off. And disagree if you disagree. No sacred cows

Be blunt, be controversial, be real . You can’t become memorable by always playing it safe. Everyone wants to be liked, and most people avoid conflict like the plague. But by doing that, you position yourself in the middle. Neither A, nor B. Neither black, nor white. People remember extremes, not mediocrity.   By doing that, you will instantly become more interesting and as a consequence more memorable.

Be irreverent. I don't mean you have to be crude (though you can be), and, certainly, humor is more than just irreverence (though when you combine irreverence with great facility with language, you're definitely in the ballpark), but irreverence is crucial.   If you divide topics in to "funny" and "not funny," you can't be funny. If you think, "don't go there," you can't be funny. If you think, "too soon," you can't be funny.   I'm not saying you should always say what's on your mind. I'm saying that inside your head, you must be irreverent. If you feel guilty for having certain thoughts -- even if you don't speak them -- you're going to be humor impaired. You must have the thought, enjoy the thought (no matter how wicked -- especially if it's wicked), and then you can decide whether or not to voice it. But if you curtail your thoughts or have internal sacred cows, you're too constrained for comedy.   The least funny people tend to be arch conservatives and extreme liberals -- people so righteous that their values become sacred to them. "How many radical feminists does it take to screw in a lightbulb?" "One, and it's not funny!" We all know the type. They exist on both sides of the political spectrum. I know Christians who get extremely offended by jokes about God. I also have a devout Christian friend who regularly makes jokes about Jesus's cock. He's not afraid to "go there." Jokes don't shake his faith. He believes God has a sense of humor.   If you're a fan of Louis C.K., you know he adores his kids. He's a pretty big celebrity, but he refuses to work more than half of each week, because he wants to spend the rest of the time with his daughters. Yet listen to how free he feels to be irreverent about them. What's the most important thing in your life -- the thing you feel most strongly about? Are you ready to dump poop on it?  

Don't be afraid to ask questions. It's not about what you do, it's about the way you do it. (Duja asks questions all the time.)


Stand by what you believe in, especially in the face of opposition.  It's that simple. Someone yells a racial slur that you find offensive, and you say, "that offends me".  Boom!  Your self-esteem +2 points. You act timid and don't say anything.  Your self-esteem -2 points.  I understand it takes courage.  It's not all downhill. A person can justify or rationalize all they want.  "It really won't hurt me to let this slide, I can't change his mind anyway."   You didn't stand up for what you believe in, your esteem went down.  Fact. 
Call out bullshit when you see it. For errors, apologies can be delivered later.
It's easy to hook up with questionable people because you are lonely -- don't succumb to that temptation. People will use and abuse you if you let them. If it feels wrong, it's probably wrong. Walk away and try again. Never be afraid to say no to something that feels wrong. And I mean wrong -- not scary. Because everything is scary at first. Everything. If you aren't scared you aren't trying. Accept being scared. Everyone is scared but most people can hide their fear. Wait and see what happens next.


Show zero tolerance for insubordination: Speak up immediately and respectfully. Catch disrespect before it turns into abuse and insubordination.

**Intentionally make mistakes** 

**There are no mistakes and the way you are supposed to be. The key is that you are enough. You know enough.** Just have natural reactions. Don’t exert to be funny.  To be unapologetic and just be, just go on, no matter what. 

**Break routines and see what happen when you do so.**

If, like many people, you’re scared of screwing-up and making mistakes, it can be helpful to sometimes intentionally make mistakes, just to see what happens. By doing this, we challenge the beliefs we hold about the way the world works. When we do something that we assume will not work, we get to explore a space that would otherwise not be visited by ourselves or by others. In the process we often discover little treasures waiting for us.

What this looks like in practice is just being fucking weird every now and then.

- Say something weird. 
- Move weirdly. 
- Do something potentially embarrassing. 
- Sing in the shower. 
- Dance in front of a mirror. 
- Challenge the status quo. For example, if people at work (including you) often seem to be trying to hide the fact that they don’t understand most of what’s going on, experiment with calling that out, “I have no idea what’s going on here. Does anyone else know?” You’ll probably feel a release of tension in the room

Make mistakes,  If you are not making mistakes, you are not improvising.  Be like a turtle: stick our your neck to make progress. When you screw up, say "Ta-dah!" and take a bow. Mistake? Focus on what comes next Let go of outcomes. Cultivate a flexible mind. Be Flexible…An improviser never really knows what he will be confronted with, so he should not be too fixated on following his own plan. He has to be willing to abandon his own ideas and go along with other people’s. Flexibility also helps to create new associations and connections.

Make mistakes, please (p. 113)
* If you are not making mistakes, you are not improvising.
* Be like a turtle: stick our your neck to make progress.
* When you screw up, say "Ta-dah!" and take a bow.
* Mistake? Focus on what comes next.
* Let go of outcomes. Cultivate a flexible mind.
* Mistakes may actually be blessings.
* Become a confident mistake-maker. Lighten up.
* Try bricolage--use what is there artfully.
* Admitting a mistake shows character.

Dare To Fail
It’s very important that a great improviser dares to fail. It is the opposite of trying to prevent every mistake. If you try to control the whole situation, you end up spending more time and money instead of making the mistake and learning from it. And learning from mistakes is a vital part of improvisation (and leadership). So go for it, fail fast and learn fast

- [It helps  to have something wrong with yourself and be comfortable with it: to be relatable](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/02/05/we-killed-book-phyllis-diller/)

It is okay to be wrong! Correctness doesn't matter, at all! Be confident playful and keep shooting with your intuition. 
Stop thinking about consequences (emails, messages, remarks etc.)
* "Fake it till you make it; confidence is more important than knowledge. Don't be intimidated by anyone”
* Fake it until you make it is a misconstrual. The better advice would be "Keep making it until it doesn't feel like you're faking it, because you actually aren't becaue there aint no such thing as perfect and there's always room for improvement”.

- Get in the habit of forgiving yourself when you make a mistake.

**Control how you feel. bhavnanaon ko sumjho** 


Don’t try to think think up words. Rather, try to feel a certain way. Control what you feel -- not what you're expressing.



Words come by automatically. Feeling are central. Ideas are secondary. 
Our brains are horrible at distinguishing fantasy from reality (think about how scared you got last time you watched a scary movie, even though you knew it was just a movie). 

Begin to align your verbal and nonverbal communication by focusing on the emotional intent of your message. Then stand up straight, pull your shoulders back and hold your head high

Examples: 

- [Cate Blanchett's emotional interview with Jimmy Fallon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xhImxF1H98) 
- [Ben Stiller's emotional iterview with Jimmy Fallon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkESoUBVQDs) 
- Improv Exercise: Portraying the same phrase with different emotions or with exaggerated emotions.



To feel positive, think about something or someone you love for a few moments before an interaction with someone. Your positive emotions will show, and your conversation partner will respond in kind. 

Pratice the feeling of **Yes, and...**. When you get a piece of information from another actor, first, accept it as fact and second, add a little bit more information to it.  Say Yes, and… The first lesson that an improviser learns is to accept every offer that is made. This basic rule is known as ‘Yes, anding.’ This principle allows improvisers to be positive and always look for new directions and opportunities. By saying ‘yes,’ you accept an idea ‘and’ you develop the idea further, making it better. An idea will quickly grow if you’re positive. You also validate the person making the offer, which opens the door to communication and collaboration.  Look for the positive spin, for what is right. Interpret everything as something positive ,  

**“If this is true, what else is true?”**

**People are going to forget what you told them, but they will remember what you made them feel.** Giving people your full presence makes them feel like they're center of your universe. **It isn't about how you make people feel about you. It's how you make them feel about themselves.**


**Tact is the ability to treat people the way they see themselves.** What this means in practice: to communicate your message in such a way that fits with the identity, values and worldview of the other person.

If there's one thing the human mind does well, it's interpreting human emotion. I was at the Exploratorium with a friend a few weeks back, and we saw an exhibit on this. We sat facing each other, each each with a list of ten phrases (e.g., "I really like you," "I'm cold," and, "Can we go now?") Then we took turns holding up a mask that covered our face -- except the eyes -- and thinking about one of the phrases. The unmasked partner had to guess which.  Using nothing but my eyes as a reference, my partner got nine out of ten correct.  

-----


**Listen To understand, not to respond** 

Forget that you are being watched. Live in the space of your situation and engage with the idea space. So often we listen just long enough to get an idea of what the other person is talking about and then we start to prepare our response, while they are still talking. This is “listening to respond.” Instead, it’s better to “listen to understand”. Visualize what the other person is saying. Listen till the last word of a sentence. 
Exercise: Play Last Word, First Word. Next time you are having a conversation with someone, focus on what they are saying, really listen and then keep listening until you hear the last word of what they’re saying. Then start your response with a word that begins with the last letter of their last word. It will force you to listen all the way through rather than getting caught up with your own inner monologue.

Listen to Understand… Many leaders listen just enough to respond. Cue sound bites from any political debate or town hall meeting. How many of us listen to understand. When having a conversation, do you think about what you are going to say next? Is your response run through the filter of ‘agenda’? Active listening facilitates understanding and authentic connection. This requires one to be “in the moment”. Which leads us to…The first key to being well spoken is making others feel well heard. We focus too much on what we should say next, formulating witty responses in our heads instead of giving full presence to the person talking. Art of listening is as important as art of speaking. When the other person feel truly "heard", that person will perceive you are caring about what s/he is saying, and this may make you appear more likable and better spoken.

----

**Watch the colour of the eyes of your partner. See their souls!**

Observe the physical sensations in your body. Your face. Your toes. How and what do you feel right now? Get in the habit of knowing how you feel right now and where you hold tension.

Focus on the colors in the eyes of your conversation partner. It's cool to notice the flecks and arrays in their irises. It brings you to the present. And it makes people feel like you're having some kind of deep, cool moment. Don't be creepy and overdo it, though. A little goes a long way. 

Do this for a split second, and it will reset your mind.

# Practice Games

Napier's framework of improvisation: throw out the "rules of improvisation", and instead focus on following one's instincts.  The trick is to practice like crazy and then let go and surrender into the present-moment. You have to learn how to let your soft animal body take over and channel all that goodness automagically through a fresh pipe. 


Don't prepare 
* Give up planning. Drop the habit of thinking ahead. Stockpiling ideas for future use is unnecessary.
* Attend carefully to what is happening right now.
    * Do not focus on things outside your control.  The solution to being better at focusing on the here-and-now doesn't come from directly thinking "I must focus on now" but instead comes from training yourself to not worry and obsess about things beyond your control. [This is why I have had problems on delegating tasks when QC Secy or when selecting UC team: I would worry about things outside my control.]
* Allow yourself to be surprised.
* Trust your imagination. There is always something in the box.
* Welcome whatever floats into your mind.
* Fear is a matter of misplaced attention. Focus on redirecting it.

**Play: Word association** 

Think of a random word, and have a friend do the same. On the count of three, both of you say the word you are thinking of, at the same time. Count to three again, and this time both of you try to say a word that is somehow between the two words you said in the first round. Continue doing this, with the goal of eventually both saying the same word. This will strengthen your ability to draw connections between things that are not obviously related.

 Free associate one thought with another: go and explore wherever they take you*
Caution: Don't do this at job interviews, where structured communication is key. 

As you go about your life, associate like crazy. Let your mind and imagination run wild and free. If you see an interesting object, start word-associating with it. 
Seeing a pretty flower might make you think of a vineyard, and then Jack and the Beanstalk, then geese, then Ryan Gosling, etc etc. Make those associations quick and snappy and try to see how far away from the original object you can get.

Add details.

**Write and speak a lot every day. Everytime you speak, do it boldly and clearly.** 


To get better at generating streams of words, you need to practice generating streams of words. 


Being able to say the first thing that comes to mind when you’re onstage is invaluable!


------


**Start a conversation with a random person on a bus or other means of public transport.**

Conversational skills are very important in improvisational theatre as you will find yourself in different scenes where you'll have to make your character more believable + you never know what crazy stuff your fellow bus rider has to offer, from settings to characters and situations.

-----

**Write every morning**, and I usually have a least one period of social time every day. 

Once you have stable and good quality content, you can **work on tuning the details of how it’s delivered.** You can work on tone, and inflection, and timing. You can tease-out that pause before the punchline while making eye contact with someone in the audience. You can slow down, stand up tall, and survey the crowd. You can breathe deeply and soften down into your legs so that your consciousness fills your body and the room, so that you can enthrall and delight the audience, so that you can entice them into your world and entertain them like royalty in your palace of presence.

------



**Do Voiceovers**  

Go to a public place and watch two people having a conversation. Perform a "voiceover" in your head of what they might be saying, giving different voices for the two characters.  Watch vox pop videos on youtube and try to imitate normal people. Observe animals when they do animal stuff. Cut the sound on a movie and try to voice over. Do it with with a wildlife documentary.

----

**Practice a new accent, Figure out how you talk - quietly, singing, loud, screaming, questioning. Stop talking high pitched through the nose, clear airways, breathe.**

Practice Sentences and Paragraphs with Audio Recorders - Use audio editors such as Audacity (Free Audio Editor and Recorder) and Practice 15 - 30 minutes a day until your general speech habits improve. Place emphasis on words, sentences, and paragraphs that are most difficult for you to articulate. Repeat certain sentences and paragraphs until they soundto pleasant 

----

**Imitate the Most Articulate Celebrities and Public Figures**

Do your best impressions of highly articulate and successful talk show hosts, news anchors, radio hosts, actors, voice actors, etc. This is a great way to invoke benchmarks that you can use as comparisons to your own voice habits and articulation level. 

Visualize Yourself Speaking Well on National Television and in Front of Large Crowds - Believe it or not, your unsatisfactory speaking habits and articulation may be rooted in the fear of being the center of attention and embarrassing yourself. Your lack of articulation could result from tension and a certain level of social anxiety that result from your own thoughts and perceptions. Picture yourself talking in situations that you think are well out of your league, and you'll start to develop the peace of mind and confidence to articulate your speech carefully in situations that would normally intimidate you. 

---


When you are out and about, **watch people,  how they behave when they are on their own, how they relate in a group, how they get each other attention.** Notice when it is that people actually have a conversation and when it is that they just take it in turn to brag. 

Being in the moment A great improviser lives in the here and now, in the present. He is alert and is able to respond instantly and sharply to changes or sudden twists and turns. This means that all sorts of other thoughts do not distract him, but that he is totally focused on things that are happening around him at that particular moment in time. By being in the present, and not judging the situation, all options are open and everything is possible.  

**Life *is* attention. Notice everything, particularly the details.** Become a detective. Shift your attention from yourself to others.  Make an effort to remember names and faces. Keep on waking up.  This moment only happens once. Treasure it. Avoid multitasking. Attend to one thing at a time. Don't prepare  Give up planning.   Attend carefully to what is happening right now. Allow yourself to be surprised.  Welcome whatever floats into your mind. Fear is a matter of misplaced attention. Focus on redirecting it.

Start with a concept, like seeing a disheveled-looking man ordering a coffee at Starbucks, and build up a story and a life around him. Create a history for him and plan a future. Ask yourself what his family is like, what he does for a living, what he does for fun, etc. If you notice something suitable for world-building, like two squirrels coming out of a tree, construct a fictional universe for them to live in. How are these squirrels related? What’s their language? Is the tree their house? Their place of work? Do they interact with other animals or are squirrels the only sentient animals in this world? Ask yourself world-building questions and then answer them.

**Play: Come up with random objects, list their uses. Then connect them**

Grab a pen, some paper and a timing device. In a few minutes time per subject, come up with as many uses as possible for the following objects (think of five random, unrelated nouns):
* A Brick
* One shoe
* A Rope
* A Tape measure
* A Stereo Speaker

Here's a quick example by Max Matterson:
- Pencil might give you: lead, words, sentence, write, sharpen, draw, pictures
- Judges could give you: sentence court, wig, life, oath, right 
- What links these two things together? You might say wright(right) and sentence... Now put them together in a joke:
- In what way are pencils and judges the same? They pass sentences, always have the last word and are wright all the time

 
- Take any two concepts:
	- Eye Trouble: Lazy eyes, tearing, cross eyed, can’t see well, have trouble reading, need glasses, world looks funny or different.
	- Dyslexia: Have trouble reading, letters and numbers look funny or different, can’t read well, can’t read quickly, have trouble concentrating.
	- These are just a couple examples thrown together in a hurry to give you the idea. Obviously there are lots of other associations we might make from these, and yet we can already see that there are some pretty useful links between the two. So all we need to do is to make these links by applying a bit of lateral thinking and then presto. You have a quick joke like...
If you are cross eyed and dyslexic, does that mean that you can see perfectly?

Example: What’s the connection between a skeleton and a bar? 
A skeleton asks a barman for a pint of beer and a mop.

There is no connection between the two except that we recognize when the skeleton drinks there is nowhere for the liquid to go except the floor. What makes it funny is that the skeleton is unable to drink but wasting his money and good beer.



Play with someone:
With a friend, brainstorm a list of random objects. Write each one down on a piece of paper, fold them up, and put them in a bowl. Draw a piece of paper at random, and set a timer for 1 minute. Come up with as many uses for that object as you can before the timer goes off. Read them aloud, crossing out the uses that the other person also listed. Whoever has the longest list at the end of this process wins.

**Anthropomorphize everything and develop personalities for them.** I find this is easiest to do with cars because their front grills are very expressive faces and their bodywork lends them a good personality. I think of BMWs as snooty french men (because of the moustache) and then the the different models of BMWs have different personalities. One thing that humans really have going for us is that we see humanity all around us. We are trained to spot faces wherever we look, like in the front grill of a car or an electrical socket. Where there is a face, there is a character.

**Character relay: start a timer that beeps every 30 seconds and then, for that 30 seconds, begin a character monologue.** There is no prompt. In fact, as much as you can, avoid preplanning any of the characters, or even thinking about the exercise. Jump right into the improvisation, and say whatever is on your mind. This is the point of the exercise.  After those 30 seconds have elapsed, instantly jump to a new character. Ideally, make it as different as possible from your previous character. Do the monologue for 30 seconds, repeat. This continues for as long as you like-- I've only done it for about 20 minutes at a time, but Napier (the author) claims to have put people through the ringer for an entire hour at a time.
	- For example: Pretend to be a crotchety, 90 year old woman for 5 minutes. Practice her voice, stance, feelings, actions and reactions. 
	- Great! Now do the same for a toddler, a stuffy English butler, a hyperactive dog, a stoned west-coast surfer, etc. etc. etc. Create different characters by playing with the way you walk, talk, move, and improvise (out loud) monologues.

Set a clock for 10 minutes. Start with a character monologue. After no more than 60 seconds, you should slip into a two character scene with that character. From there, keep "cutting to" or wiping to related scenes, flashbacks, flashforwards, or completely new scenes. The two goals are a) to improvise nonstop for 10 minutes and b) to create as many characters and situations in 10 minutes as possible. Do one of these as a practice, and then do one for real. Let yourself be creative in your "cut-to" situations. This exercise strengthens an improvisor's sense of responsibility onstage - you quickly learn that you can't bail on a scene or check out mentally! It also builds your confidence, playfulness and your facility in being able to play and heighten a moment in a long form.

**Do Solo Three Line Scenes**

These will feel strange at first, but it's a great exercise to add to your warm-ups, as it gets your brain moving and gets you to commit fully to a range of characters. 

- In character, initiate a scene with an opening line. 
- Then, changing your physicality and even your physical position, Immediately switch to a contrasting character - the larger the contrast, the better, and deliver the second line of the scene. 
- Then, move back into the original position, physicality and attitude of the first character and deliver the third line of the scene. 

For the first few of these, start off being easy on yourself, then tighten up the scenes. Focus on getting out the who, what and where in those scant three lines. Work through negative and dismissive responses until you are only giving yourself positive agreements with each three-line scene. Push your range of characters and your range of contrasts - you should keep doing these until you are well beyond your stock characters.


Solo Two Character Scenes/three character scenes .
Once you have warmed up with three line scenes, slow down and try an extended two-character scene. 
Focus on giving gifts to yourself - "Rosemary, your pale gauntness is delicious!" 

Let these go a little long so that you can explore the possibilities of being the sole driver of a scene. As you slip between characters, let yourself be physically neutral. Take care to keep the characters' physicalities distinct. After a couple of these, challenge yourself to try three character and group scenes.

**Grab any postcard or photo or picture at random, and proceed to articulate in detail, preferably in a loud voice, what's in the picture**

Whats the theme/what's in the foreground/what's in the background/what's in the centre or middle/what's on the right/what's on the left/what's at the top/what's at the bottom/what at the top-right/top-left/bottom-right/bottom-left/what's happening/is it inside or outside/who's there/how's the weather and/or timing; how do you know/compare and contrast/how do you feel/what do you like/what do you dislike/would you like to be in the postcard or photo or picture; why and why not?

**Play: Given random settings and objects, create a story**

Get 10 index cards.  Write one object on each of them.  Anything.  You can write "flowers" on one and "Belgian waffle" on another.  Now take a few moments to write five settings on a sheet of paper.  Examples can include: "ballroom dancing class," "hostage negotiation," "brewery tour."

Shuffle your cards.  Pull two out and put them face up in front of you.  Create a  story involving these two items in the first setting that you listed.  It doesn't have to be humorous at first, just plausible.  As you keep going, you can try to make it humorous.  Repeat until you complete the set.  Reshuffle.  Repeat.  Make it funnier each time.

**Study how they do it**

- Mae West
- Mark Twain
- Dorothy Parker
- Wilde
- Churchill
- Shaw
- Groucho
- Han and Leia (Star Wars)
- Piers Morgan
- Jeremy Clarkson
- Scalia
- John Oliver
- Tom Lehrer
- Woody Allen
- Tim Minchin
- Trevor Noah
- Kurt Vonnegut
- Simon Rich
- Tina Fey
- Douglas Adams
- Miranda July
- Louis CK
- Bo Burnham's "what."  I have to admit, the above clip makes me jealous when I watch it. I wish when was in my 20s I had had 1/10 the talent Bo has. The whole clip is good but the last ten minutes I was like (starting at 52:40): Oh my god, how did he come up with that?
- Jimmy Fallon is changing late-night TV. There's no way I can keep up with that sort of energy. But I love his SNL audition reel and the sheer talent he shows
- Seth Rogen: injects humor into an incredibly serious issue in a congressional hearing
- Amy Schumer
- Marina Franklin: carries a sweet innocence, and then violates expectations 
- "Food" by Jim Gaffigan
- Anthony Jeselnik: I like how he connects with the audience just when you think they should be hating hi
- Daniel Tosh. Daniel Tosh is the reason I stopped using powerpoints in my talks. Because you can compare how funny he is between his standup and his show Tosh where he has youtube videos as props. He's about 1/10 as funny in the show.I then read later that powerpoints use a different part of the brain and that using them in a talk forces the brain to over-work so people can't focus on your talk as well.
- Andy Samberg's Harvard commencement speech:  I don't think he makes sense for even one second during the entire speech. Which means he totally goes for it. He's committed to the end to stay in character no matter how confused the audience is. It's hard to be that committed when you have no idea what people are thinking.

**Recommended Books**

* Improvise: Scene from the Inside Out by Mick Napier

    This book will make you feel angry that you could have been doing this all along, and then it will make you happy that now you know.
* The Small Cute Book of Improv by Jill Bernard. 

    The world’s best improv book by volume. It is incredibly small (20 pages, each of them sx by six inches) but packed with great advice delivered with fun. The revised edition (“now less small!”) contains some mini-essays that on their own would justify the cost.

- Impro for Storytellers by Keith Johnstone

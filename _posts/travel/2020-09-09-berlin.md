The first thing that struck a note with me as I exited the Schonefeld airport was Currywurst, a term which provoked both intrigue and amusement. This food item encapsulated all history and cultures that were part of my journey -  an Indian, living in Britain, visiting Germany. "Wurst" is the German for sausage (as in "Bratwurst"), a food item as staple to Germans as Roti is to Indians. And "Curry" is the British term for, well... most Indian food. At some point during the rebuilding of Germany post WWII someone made the genius discovery that Curry Powder (which the British used), goes very well with ketchup and German sausage.

And then there was the Graffiti. It is everywhere: on the walls, on the bus stops, on the bus waiting seats, on constructions old and new. Anything you could put paint on in Berlin, you have Graffiti.

Why is there so little air-conditioning? I had actually not noticed this peculiarity until I asked the cool receptionist[^Anna] at Circus Hostel about the airconditioning there, and she rhetorically asked me: Have you seen air-conditioning elsehwere? 

[^Anna]: Anna, a Peruvian who lived in Germany for nine years and had worked at the hostel for five.

In a city known for its cafes and public transport, it is positively absurd that none of these spaces are air-conditioned - and especially noticable during the hot days of summer. 

I heard different reasons for it from different sources: a concern for the environment, building regulations, or because they look ugly.

If you're wondering how to decadence can thrive side-by-side with social justice, look no further than Berlin, a city in which public drinking is only not illegal, but the norm, and even encouraged, for the bottles you leave behind in the parks or pavements can be picked up and returned in deposited  by those who are in need of money. (For sources: the recycling deposit ranges from 8-15 cents for glass and 15-25 for plastic)

The Trams are truly marvelous. They cut right throught the middle of the city, the middle of the road; they seemed super-efficient and accessible; and with their  bright yellow colours, they make add another hip factor to the city.

And it was while sitting in a tram that I heard, from the operator, "[IndiraGandhiStraze](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira-Gandhi-Stra%C3%9Fe)", a stoppage and street named after Indira Gandhi - in Berlin!

Lastly, the people. Over the course of my six days, I had some really good, meaninful encounters with the locals. 

- Tanya, my couchsurfing host who had the idea for doing a barbeque for dinner
- The Kurdish Uber cab driver who had been in Germany for 30 years and felt Germans were racist
- Lena and Baron. Lena grew up in Friedrichshain and were full of useful tidbits of information
- Barbara, who showed me the neighbourhood where she lived, alongwith the train tracks. Also introduced me to Radler, the lemonade-beer, which I have grown to like. 
- James from US, who was freewheeling enough to accompany us to Brandenberg Gate at 3 am and give us a tour of Reichstag and Checkpoint Charlie
- The pub quiz team at Das Gift in Neukolm, where we won by a huge margin
- Zandra, the couchsurfer who I went to drinks at Milchbar
- Not to forget, the friendly waitresses at Lisboa Bar!

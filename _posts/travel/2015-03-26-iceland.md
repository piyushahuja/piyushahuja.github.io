**Day 0**

This was my first sight of Iceland


The winds at the desolate Keflavic airport are lashing at us as if it were the end of the world. We renta car and make our way to our AirBnB, which turns out to be a modernist, airy and spacious bungalow with glass walls. 

We meet our host, who spoke in the amusing Icelandic accent. We made him pronounce [Eyaflatjokull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull).

----

**Day 1**

We did the [Golden Cicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Circle_(Iceland)).

True to form, Duja ignored the big geysers and spotted budding baby geyser.

We have brunch with [Ruggbraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BAgbrau%C3%B0) - bread baked from the very fire of the earth.

I lost my phone when doing the Golden Circle, and only realized near the end of the trip. Finding it seemed like a lost cause when we returned to our AirBnB.   I played the events of the previous day in my mind, and deduced, that I must have dropped the phone at a bridge and river crossing where we had stopped for photography - and no whereelse. I convinced the team to drive there again. It had snowed overnight, so there was still little hope of finding it. Manan was trying my phone all this time, and on our way back, it rang and someone picked it up. Someone had found it at the spot we were looking it for, and handed it over to the nearby Pingvellir national park centre, where we had stopped as well. Remakably, I found my phone intact.


At night we walk around Rejkjavik. I come across the Lebowski Bar. We eat at an American-style Burger joint. We visit [Hallgrímskirkja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallgr%C3%ADmskirkja), whose sheer majesty has me in complete awe.

**Day 2**

After collecting my phone from Thingvellir, we started on [Route 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_1_(Iceland)) via Selfoss. 

We saw the two waterfals on our way.

- [Seljalandsfoss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljalandsfoss). This is the one where you can walk behind the waterfall. 
- [Skógafoss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sk%C3%B3gafoss). This is the larger one where you have to climb a lot of steps. 


I introduced Duja to Sigur Ros, which she mockingly started calling Sugar Floss. 

We reach the beach [at this place](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyrh%C3%B3laey). It is lovely. We are so happy. 

We drive to Klaustur at [Klauster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkjub%C3%A6jarklaustur). I venture out at night to practice some night photography and get lucky with Auroras. But no luck - it is cloudy.  

----

**Day 3**



We walk on a floating ice slab in a [glacial lagoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6kuls%C3%A1rl%C3%B3n). 

At about 3 pm, we reach the place we had booked at Hofn. It is a beautiful cottage with wooden floors. The hosts tell us about the [hot pots](
https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189960-d10223970-Reviews-Hoffell_Hot_Tubs-Hofn_East_Region.html). 


We relax in hot pots filled with steaming water heated with geothermal hear from the earth. Later we wait in the car patiently for the Auroras, waiting for the clouds to clear. Still no luck.


----

**Day 4**



After doing a tour of the glacier, we make our way back Route 1, on our way to the hostel I had booked at [Vik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%ADk_%C3%AD_M%C3%BDrdal).


From the hilly side of Vik, the three of us (Manan, me and Rodolfo) identify the Aurora glow for the first time in the trip. We shout out to the girls who are far below near the foot of the hillock, but they get scared of the three shadows shouting at them and scoot away.



----

**Day 5**


We venture out in the freezing night to try our luck with the Northern Lights. We spot them and capture it.  

----

**Day 6**

Back to Rejkjavik. 

We eat hot dogs and try the famously disgusting [Hakarl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A1karl) at the flea market. I find it tolerable. Manan gets interested in some pants at the flea market (They belong to the boyfriend of the seller, whose pants I suspect Manan  *actually* wants to get into, rather those he is wanting to buy). I help him negotiate it down by playing the bad cop in the the good cop/bad cop routine. 


Next morning we fly back. We buy some drinks. [Brennevin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenniv%C3%ADn) was quite good, but I found [Björk Liqueur](https://nammi.is/bjork-liqueur-50-cl.html) to be unique and refreshingly good.


-----

We are a fun bunch. 

We realize everyone has their own catchphrases. For Shohini, it is "I am doing X because of the people". For Manan, it is "Define X". For Candade, who is a social anthropolgy student, is is "X is a social construct". 

Some of the music from the trip:

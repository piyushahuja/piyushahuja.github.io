[A day in the of Abbey Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9m7saxzv-Q)

This is one of those meaningfully silly-but-fun things you can do with your friends. I still reminisce with fondness the two times I’ve been here, whereas the experiences of art galleries, monuments and museum tours I've largely forgotten. There is an unadulterated romance to the place. It hasn't sold off to the tourism industry or modern day capitalism. It's neither advertised nor commercialised. You wouldn't find people trying to sell it to you. Or sell stuff to you when you're there. It is just a zebra crossing. A zebra crossing imbued with aesthetic meaning, connecting people across time and distance, across generations and geographies. And everyone who visits has their own personal connection with Abbey Road.

This is when life mimics are. There is no fabrication or artifice. The first time I was here Platform 9 3/4 Quarters at St. Cross would come a close second, whereas 221 b Baker Street is now a full museuem with ticket prices and shit, and dont even get me started on the prices that football clubs (read ‘profit hungry business ventures’) chargee.  -->

**Wasdale, Lake District**

Dates Friday 12th June - 14 June

My first wild camping trip. I got introduced to the Walking Club members: Kerrie, Imogen, Jaya, Grainne, Natasha Ng, some of whom I'd meet again in subsequent trips.

We climbed Scafell Pike, England's highest peak. The climb was a bit rocky and not very pleasant.

On our way back from Scafell Pike, we got a bit lost and separated from our group. Kerrie seemed to like the Elton John music that I played to calm the nerves.

This was a weekend at a vineyard with Sourav Kalra and his partner.

Friday was Valentine's Day formal at Hughes' Hall, and on Saturday we had brunch at Kings College before heading down south.

On our way back, we visited Winchester.

Despite the glut of <i>people-discovery</i> products in the market (social networks, dating apps, interest-based communities), there is still a huge set of use-cases waiting to be unlocked in this space.  <!--  The associated consumer welfare is untapped and represents an opportunity.

Particularly, I am exploring this idea via digital products: <b>How do we encourage social networking via interpersonal learning and teaching amongst wider public?</b> 

<p>The value of teaching someone something is immmense, not just to the student, but to the teacher as well. Apart from the alturistic boost from helping someone learn, one builds self-esteem, and gets to practice their competencies. Besides, explaining a concept or demonstrating a skill to someone is the best way to learn it.</p>

<p>The student not only learns something, but also retains it better.</p>

and forms a bond with a fellow human being.  -->

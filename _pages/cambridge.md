**Which area is the best for renting?**

There are various questions to consider: how important is the city centre to you? Are you looking for something close to colleges or would you rather stay away from the student crowd? Do you prefer city liveliness or nature-quiet? Cheaper rent or plush furnishings?

Mill Road ranks high in distance to city centre, liveliness, cost-effectiveness and hipness. It has South Asian supermarkets, African restaurants and a worldly atmosphere. At the top of Mill Road is a great sports centre with a swimming pool. But rooms are likely to be a bit shoddy, the roads are not pristine, and its one of the less green areas of town.

Hills Road and the area next to train station is likely to have more modern housing. It is lively but expensive. Continying straight onto the city centre, it has plenty of modern shops, cafes and restaurants.

Cherry Hinton area has some good housing at affordable prices near wider roads and green expanses. It is a bit further away from city centre: one can live there without ever getting in touch with the university.  It has the best Indian Supermarket in town and attracts the desi community. 

The more north of the river Cam one goes, a lot less nicer is gets. Chesterton area is not bad, but Arbury looks run-down and feels quite far from city centre, even though it isnt.

If you are not looking for lively restaurants or affordable housing, but looking for surrounds that clean, posh, quiet and green close to the university, look at western part of Cambridge, such as Newnham.

**Where can I find free [parking](https://roadtripheroes.com/free-parking-in-cambridge-uk)?**


- Ward Road
- Norman Way
- Eltisley Avenue
- Chalmers Road
- Rosemary Lane
- Glebe Road
  
All these areas offer unrestricted parking spots for free of cost and the distance from these spots to the main city or city centre is just a mile or so. So, it takes about 15 to 20 minutes of walking only for you to reach the city centre or simply take a bus service to get right into the main city.

----

**What are some good viewing spots?**

* Climbing the tower at Great St Mary
* Varsity Hotel Bar
* Castle Hill Mound. Just an odd path at the back of a car park, but really great views over the city. 
* The view point at the top of line kiln bank gives fantastic views from the other side of town

**What are some famous stories and traditions associated with the city?**


Parker's Piece can be said to be "the birthplace of association football"

> Here on Parker's Piece, in the 1800s, students established a common set of simple football rules emphasising skill above force, which forbade catching the ball and 'hacking'. These 'Cambridge Rules' became the defining influence on the 1863 Football Association rules

Grantchester is said to have the highest concentration of Nobel Laureaes in the world.

**I am coming for a day trip from London. Help me plan my trip**
  
Do a loop through as many or as few colleges as you like starting from Magdalene College, along The Backs over the Silver Street bridge, through Pembroke and up to Emma or Downing. 


**The Backs Walk**

*University buildings and their impeccably manicured lawns, the river Cam and its various bridges. Grazing cattle to be spotted all along this stretch of reclaimed land. Provides cracking angle from which to admire those colleges that touch the water’s edge, Stunning, especially in the magic hour*
  

Starting from Fitzwilliam Museum and the nearby Fitzbillies (restaurant famous among university students for Chelsea Buns), one can walk a loop that runs through major points of attraction. Turn left to Silver Street, up to Queens college where you can see The Mathematical Bridge.[^bridge] 

[^bridge]:This pretty wooden footbridge is another gorgeous spot to breathe in a little of Cambridge’s chilled-out charm. This Grade II listed building, designed by William Etheridge and built by James Essex in 1749, takes its name from the arrangement of its timbers at certain tangents to create its arching shape. There is a myth that Sir Isaac Newton built the bridge without the help of any nuts or bolts, which, though untrue, makes a cheeky anecdote to share with your travel buddy as you stroll across.


Go towards Newnham College (lovely college with intriguing artwork at the entrance), University Library (UL), and then to the Backs ("backs of colleges"). 


Cross over the river at Garret Hostel Bridge and watch the Corpus Clock[^chronophage], The Eagle, Kings college chapel, Senate house, Newton's Tree, St. Johns, Round Church[^round].


[^chronophage]:With a face made entirely of gold, a metal grasshopper called the Chronophage or ‘time-eater’ sitting above it and an undulating ripple design, which suggests the expansion of the universe after the Big Bang


Picnic on River Cam riverbanks, cross King’s College Bridge. Sitting on the wall outside The Mill with a pint in a plastic glass is one of life's best things.


Head out over Jesus Green to the river and watch some rowing/see the colourful boathouses, before looping back into town over Midsummer Common.

Six restaurant is high up in Varsity hotel so you get a great view over the rooftops 



[^round]: Officially known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Round Church is a Grade I listed building dating back to 1130. Its beautiful rotunda structure is formed of stone. The church’s upper storey, built above the nave, has a glorious conical spire on top, making this a pretty unique space to explore.


 **Visit a college**

The classic is a walk around some of the colleges' courts. In some colleges you pay for the entrance (King's, St. Johns, Trinity) but don't be fooled: the other colleges are free and as nice! Jesus, Christ (these are two separate ones :D ), Peterhouse, Pembroke, etc. Usually they only give access to two or three internal courts and to the chapel. These are usually nice sights, but if you read something about their history before going, you might complement the sight with some interesting anecdotes. the Fellows garden at Clare is beautiful. 

Most of the big colleges (Clare, trinity, johns, kings, Jesus etc) have a couple of evensongs during the week. Just need to find one that’s on the night you’re around. They’re free for anyone to attend. Even if you’re not religious, they’re pretty amazing to go to once.

Emmanuel college is really chill about people wandering in to look round, and has loos that are closer to the bus station than the Grand Arcade. 

* Evensong at Kings College. One of England’s finest examples of Perpendicular Gothic architecture. With the largest fan-vaulted ceiling in the world and some dazzling examples of medieval stained glass, you’ll find yourself gazing heaven-wards to drink in its daunting beauty. 

Look at for [Dinky Doors](https://www.dinkydoors.co.uk/tour). These are 14 miniature sculptures hidden just out of plain sight, delivering a doze of unexpected wonder as you wander. Not all of them are in the city centre, but look out for the one at 10 Downing Street.

**Punting**


If you’d prefer some solitude you can go a mile or two upriver, past the weir to the village of Grantchester. The backdrop here is more rural, and you can reward yourself with a pub lunch before floating back towards Cambridge. Students and tourists often travel from Cambridge by punt to picnic in Grantchester Meadows or take tea at The Orchard. The footpath to Cambridge that runs beside Grantchester Meadows is nicknamed the Grantchester Grind. Bring a bottle of wine or some hot chocolate (in winters), absolutely the best way to see the beautiful college backs.

**I have seen it all. What else can I do?**


* A walk in the Botanical Garden
* DNA Bike Path
* Grounds of Cherry Hinton Hall
* Cherry Hinton Brook
* Mill Road Cemetery
* Logan's Meadow
* Ely This one isn’t technically in Cambridge, but it makes for a brilliant day trip. Dating back to 1083, it is built in the monumental Romanesque style. Take a moment to gaze up at the church’s captivating ceilings and dazzling stained glass.
* Grantchester
* [Anglesey Abbey](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey-gardens-and-lode-mill)
* Wild Swimming: Houghton Mill in the summer is a good wild swimming spot
Another similar spot I discovered recently is St Helen's Picnic Site in Thetford Forest, if you're ever out that way. Although no boating. Lovely water (although a bit shallower than HM) and greats walks. There's a beautiful tiny church there too.

**I live here, and I would like to finding community**

The best way to find community is join a group of hobbyists.

What are you into?

**Shops and Cafes**


* Fitzbillies. Definitely the highest calorie thing to do in Cambridge is to drop into the gorgeous Fitzbillies on Trumpington Street and feast on one of their famous Chelsea Buns. These sticky-sweet snacks have been on sale here since 1921 and make for an ideal riverside energy boost when your punting enthusiasm begins to wane. 
* Waterstones Book Cafe
* For spicy food, visit Pho Vietnamese (Vietnamese)
* Parker's Tavern


* Harry Potter: A small one would be to visit the (semi)-secret Harry Potter shop in the tourist information center. It’s pretty cool if you’re into the wizarding world
  

----

**Food, Pubs and Alcohol-Fuelled Fun**

* The Granta on the fen is a really lovely pub to watch the sun set
* Fort St George by the river is a nice spot to watch the rowers go up and down if you're so inclined. Both do good food.
* Cambridgeshire Wine School. Not only will you sample delightful wines from Europe and even further afield, you’re bound to make some fabulous new friends, too. Choose evenings dedicated to Italian tipples, South American or Portuguese recipes. There’s even a cheese and wine event if you’re a fan of fancy fromage.
* Beer: Cambridge Blue best place for beer selection.
* [Cocktail Bar and Music](

**Live Events**


* For Standup Comedy: The Tram Depot
* Live Music: Try The Portland Arms. Check what gigs are coming up. The Blue Moon is also OK for nightlife, as is Q Club on certain nights. The night scene can seem fairly limited in Cambridge. A cafe/bar called CB2 also has some good live events in the basement downstairs.
* ADC Theatre. There is a cheap, but always VERY good, theatre run by students, with two venues: the ADC theatre and the Corpus Playroom. During Christmas they do smaller (outsourced) productions: I have never been at one of those so I'm not sure about their quality. The theatre and its companies are also renowned for their prominent history and alumni

**Visual Art**

Kettle’s Yard. For a sprinkle of culture, head along to Kettle’s Yard, a gorgeous Cambridge house filled with a collection of 20th-century art, which also has its own contemporary gallery. There are exhibitions on display for much of the year and events including study days, art workshops and music recitals. It's a "house museum" (free but you should book your slot in advance). It was owned by an art lover and expert who collected proper masterpieces and put them in his place. It's different from any other art museum you can visit (at least, that I visited!) and it leaves you in awe! The collector and first modern art curator of the Tate Gallery, Jim Ede lived at this property on Castle Street in the 20th century. Kettle’s Yard is made up of four separate cottages joined together, and every afternoon Ede and his wife Helen would open their house to visitors to give a tour of his collection. The home and all its art were donated to the University of Cambridge in the 60s and the layout, books, home furnishings and laidback atmosphere are all holdovers from when the Edes were here. The collection is a who’s who of the British avant-garde in the first decades of the 20th century and has works by Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and David Jones, but also Joan Miró, Helen Frankenthaler and Henri Gaudier-Brzeska.

**Museums**


**Fitzwilliam Museum.** The brilliantly diverse collection includes arms, coins, Cypriot, Greek and Egyptian art by Degas, Reubens and Gainsborough among countless others. Many consider it the finest small museum in all of Europe

The museum of Natural Sciences, the museum of Zoology, the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. They are all located in Downing Street and each one takes just one hour to visit. I particularly like the Zoology one, that has also a nice cafeteria.


**Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences**

The collections at the **Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology** cover nearly two million years of human history and come from all six of the world’s inhabited continents. The museum goes back to 1884 and moved into purpose-built premises in 1913, refurbished and reopened in 2013 on its centenary.

Some of the most captivating things to see are the ethnographic pieces picked up by the explorer Captain James Cook during his three expeditions in the 18th century.

There are also Roman and Anglo-Saxon artefacts unearthed in digs around Cambridge and East Anglia, while the oldest item is a stone tool discovered in Tanzania’s Olduvai Gorge and dating back 1.8 million years.

One exhibit that literally stands out is the towering 19th-century Haida totem pole from Tanu in British Columbia.

If this list has already got you thinking Cambridge rocks, let us dig a little deeper and recommend you a **Geology museum** that’s pure gold. The oldest of Cambridge University’s museums, it was founded in 1728 and is now home to around two million minerals, fossil and rocks.


**The Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI)** was founded in 1920 as a memorial to Captain Robert Falcon Scott and his team, who died in 1912 in Antarctica on the return trek from the South Pole. The SPRI runs the museum at the institute at the building, recording the feats achieved during the “Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration”. The museum has photographs, pieces of archive footage, drawings and paintings. You can view arts and crafts by people indigenous to the Arctic, as well as equipment from polar expeditions and the last letters written by Scott during his ill-fated trek

**The Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences** is Cambridge’s oldest museum and was created when the geologist John Woodward bequeathed his collection of fossils to the university in 1728. Some of Woodward’s fossils can still be viewed in their original 18th-century cabinets.

In all the museum has about two million rock, fossil and mineral specimens.

Standing guard by the entrance to the museum is Iggy the Iguanodon, the plaster replica of a dinosaur skeleton discovered in a mine in 1878, and was donated to the museum by the King of Belgium in 1878. Also fascinating is the set of 2,000 rocks and fossils gathered by Charles Darwin during his expedition on the HMS Beagle, and there are also numerous meteorites, each presented with a thin section showing their optical properties.

The biggest **aviation museum** in Britain is at a former RAF base 10 miles south of Cambridge.

There are five hangars, including the recently extended “Hangar 1”, which houses more than 30 aircraft starting with the First World War.

In Hangar 2 you can see planes that are in working order, and watch restoration work in progress, while Hangar 3 combines naval aircraft and vessels and Hangar 4 is devoted to the Battle of Britain during the Second World War.

Beyond all this you can enter Duxford’s preserved Operations Room, check out the tanks, artillery and armoured cars in the Land Warfare Hall and marvel at the B-52 and Blackbird in the American Air Museum.


**Imperial War Museum** As well as an enormous airfield, this museum also boasts a collection of 200 vintage aircraft (including Concorde and the Spitfire) which have been carefully restored to their hey-day glory and are displayed proudly from floor to ceiling at what is the largest aviation museum in Europe.

**I’m looking for places to go in a day, leaving from Cambridge and let’s say up to 15 kms away. Ideally some sort of park or point of view as the destination, and heading outside the city. We’ll be taking the kids on our cargo bike, so roads with bike paths are preferred. As an example I’ve taken the kids to campus by bike before and the mix of small roads/bike paths was ok.**



* [Ickworth](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/ickworth) is nice for kids to visit but is national trust so you will have to book on Friday when they release tickets (if you are a member) 

* Also you can cycle around [fulbourn nature reserve](https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/local/fulbourn-fen-south-cambridgeshire) and local villages are quite nice

* [Fen Drayton Lakes](https://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/reserves-a-z/fen-drayton-lakes/) area is pretty nice. Easy riding along the busway to get there and nice little walks around lakes and things once you are in the area. lots of bird life so bring binoculars! 

* There are some cycle routes around [wimpole estate](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/features/cycle-at-wimpole-estate-cambridgeshire) but might be all cycling on major roads to get there unfortunately. The grounds around Wimpole Hall are lovely, [here’s a page](https://www.camcycle.org.uk/newsletters/105/article11.html) discussing the various routes to cycle there. There is also a new multi use trail around [Wimpole Hall estate](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wimpole-estate/features/wimpoles-proposed-multi-use-trail).Ridden on 24th June and is open as a circular route.


* I quite like cycling over the river at the green dragon bridge, then along the river to the north, then it looks like you can cut across to milton country park for some walks coffee/gelato at the cafe.

* Wandelbury.  the cycle path on the pavement extends all the way up the hill (A1307)... it's cycle-able from cambridge (the last hill is a bit steep if you’re not used to it!) and biking means you don’t have to pay an entry fee. Look out for the Dinky Door! quite easily accessible on a continuous bike path along Babraham Rd and has a little tadpole pond, a den building area, some tree trunks to climb on and sometimes cows on a meadow to watch. Great for kids. You could cycle to Wandlebury. There's a cycle path along the A1307 from the Addenbrooke's roundabout to the entrance. It's uphill from Addenbrookes on the way there but then you get a nice downhill cycle on the way back.

* Fulbourn Fen (off Stonebridge Lane) for a walk...woods with an odd mix of pasture in the middle & access to Fleam Dyke. You might be able to get to the sawston oasis. Head down the DNA cycle path, go through Stapleford and by the road. Just on your right

* The guided bus route to the north of the city goes through a pleasant bird sanctuary with some walking around space. There is some bike parking. But there is (apart from a few car crossings) a vehicle free path. It's about 10 miles (I have done it a few times on my (non-electric) Winther Kangaroo. The pathway from Milton Road and Kings hedges is so nice, it's where I've been teaching my eldest to ride.

* Also consider Wicken fen as somewhere to go to get out of town. Not really buildings as destinations, but some options. 

* [Bartlow hill](http://thelostbyway.com/2016/05/pyramids-essex-bartlow-hills.html
) is nice spot


* Milton Country Park is a nice bike ride along the river (you could also go all the way to Waterbeach which I heard is nice, too, but have never been myself so far), however, there are two large ponds and I don’t know how old your children are and if you are comfortable with large accessible water bodies around them ;-)

* some nice bike routes, from the city centre to Fen Ditton and from the city centre to Waterbeach, both along or close to the Cam. Also via Trumpington into the Grantchester meadows and back to Cambridge.



* There's also a nice cycle from the Stapleford Granary. If you turn into the granary and follow the track, it ends up in Babraham but before that, there's a bridge/river where kids can paddle, fish, etc. The track is quite gravelly and it's narrow near the bridge so I'm not sure how easy it would be for a cargo bike but it's lovely if you can make it that far.

* [this page](https://www.komoot.com/guide/17345/road-cycling-routes-in-cambridgeshire)  I noticed that route 8 mentions the Old Butchers cafe/shop in Balsham. They are currently open (June 2020) & have been advertising their recent acquisition of a soft-serve ice cream machine.

* [Brook Leys parkland](https://eddington-cambridge.co.uk/explore/parks-and-open-spaces)

* [the cycle path](http://www.gps-routes.co.uk/routes/home.nsf/RoutesLinksWalks/cambridge-to-st-ives-along-the-busway-walking-and-cycle-route#) along the guided busway that connects Cambridge and St Ives. It is off-traffic the whole route and reasonably flat in its 10 miles. 

* Cambridge to St. Ives via the https://www.thebusway.info/, and couple of miles further (if you have energy) there’s https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/houghton-mill-and-waterclose-meadows - a nice mill you can visit and a very nice river kids can splash in. St. Ives is 12 miles from North Cambridge via the guided busway - it may be a bit further than you’d want to cycle.

* The Roman Road from Fulbourn to Horseheath is a great walking and cycling path, though it’s borderline with a cargo bike and young kids. Entry point on google maps is marked [here](https://www.google.com/maps/search/roman+road+near+Fulbourn,+Cambridge/@52.1599457,0.1919989,15.46z). There’s also [nice information on](https://frrfd.org.uk/), though they make it sound and look like it’s only walkable.

I did the 6th route on [this page](https://www.komoot.com/guide/670893/road-cycling-routes-around-cambridge), “Lovely view loop from Cambridge”, and it was a great ride. It’s good as you know the routes are tried and tested by cyclists, so it won’t kick you onto a highway as Google Maps sometimes does!

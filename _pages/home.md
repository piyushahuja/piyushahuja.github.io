The people and art we love could reveal our interiority  in a way that any biography or self-description cannot. 







Some things I love:

----

**Movies**




----

**Celebrities that I find inspiring**


* Actress Cate Blanchett
* Football Manager Jurgen Klopp
* Philosopher Amia Srinivasan
* 


----

**Music**

These fill with a sense of freedom and possibility and expansiveness. Or are associated with particular happy moments in my life.

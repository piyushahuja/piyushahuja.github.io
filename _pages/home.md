I'm always hesitate to share such lists: would I continue loving the things I love now, or would it change? Do the things I love say something about my essence, or are they a result of whim, chance and happenstance?

Nevertheless, the things we love can reveal aspects of our interior lives  in a way that any biography or self-description cannot.

**Music**

These songs fill with a sense of freedom and possibility and expansiveness. Or are associated with particular happy moments in my life.

**Movies**


I enjoy movies directed by Wes Anderson and Hayao Miyazaki (of Studio Ghibli). 


I love Contact (1997), Titanic (1997), The Matrix (1999), Lakshya (2004), Finding Forrester,
The Social Network, Eternal Sunshine on the Spotless Mind, Carol,  The Truman Show, Proof, Blade Runner, Starter For Ten, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Catch Me If You Can.

I have a soft spot for the following themes:

* coming-of-age (Brooklyn, Lakshya, An Education, Starter For Ten, Kiki's Delivery Service)
* authentic middle-class family relationships (An Education, Almost Famous, A Separation, Taare Zameen Par, Fantastic Mr. Fox)
* meritocratic rise of an underdog (Contact, Finding Forrester, Forrest Gump, La La Land, Proof, A Beautiful Mind, Goal).
* space travel (Contact, Interstellar, Gravity)
* death and the human condition (The Fountain, The Man From Earth)

I would love any recommendations based on this list!

I am currenty a senior software engineer based in Cambridge (UK). I enjoy learning, teaching, and creative collaborations. 

<!-- My long-term project, [Platonia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.platonialabs.platonia), can now be downloaded on Google playstore. One of the best way to learn is to teach it to someone. Platonia allows you to organize one-on-one meetups with people near you for learning-and-teaching. -->
**Educational Background**

I read for a second BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford.  I was supported by the KC Mahindra Scholarship, [Tiara Special Grant](https://www.tiarafoundation.com/copy-of-tiara-special-grant), and a second undergraduate degree scholarship by Harris Manchester College.

Before Oxford, I graduated from [IIT Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Delhi) with a five-year Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Computing in 2013. My master's thesis was in the design of approximation algorithms for networks under [Naveen Garg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen_Garg). Here's a [link to my thesis][thesis].

**Creative Collaborations**

If you'd like to collaborate on something for fun, don't hesitate to reach out! Don't worry about ideas - my notebooks are overflowing with them, and it would be great to riff-off each other. Primarily, I am interested in podcasts, sketch comedy and mobile apps.

**Currently**

I am on a career break. 

Ancient Greeks used to believe that an unexamined life is not worth living. But a life lived constantly examining it is not worth living as well. I am using my time off to *live* philosophy in an embodied way, one that moves away from the cold metal bars of the life of the mind to the vivid and velvety feel of lived experience. 

I am also working on bringing the following projects to life

* Salt To Taste: a series of essays on authenticity
* [A Writing Course](https://piyushahuja.com/courses/writing/intro)
* [A Newcomer's Guide to Cambridge](/cambridge)
* [Grey Masala](https://open.spotify.com/show/4fwl2XZOBsSZFFQH2Jaec4): a philosophy podcast 
* Meeting Without Masks: conscious dating in Cambridge
* Platonia: a social network based on skills

I am based in Cambridge and frequently travel to London and Oxford. 


<!-- **Also**



I would love to run a meditation group and [a writing workshop](/courses/writing/intro) in Cambridge. I'm looking for volunteer participants: if this interests you, please reach out!

**Previous Work**

Between 2019 - 2023, I was a senior software developer at Wellcome Sanger Institute.

[The work experience page](/work) lists my work history.

**Education** 

I read for a second BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford.  I was supported by the KC Mahindra Scholarship, [Tiara Special Grant](https://www.tiarafoundation.com/copy-of-tiara-special-grant), and a second undergraduate degree scholarship by Harris Manchester College. [These are some essays](/philosophy) I wrote in my time at Oxford. 

Before Oxford, I graduated from IIT Delhi with a five-year Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Computing in 2013. My master's thesis was in the design of approximation algorithms for networks under [Naveen Garg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen_Garg). 

[The research page](/research) has a summary of my research during university.

**Hobbies** 


In my free time, I like to draw portraits and try new recipes.

I used to be a competitive quizzer. I had my 15 minutes on fame when I appeared on some [nationally televised quiz shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5pdjrdj0uA) in my college days.

<!-- 
 One of the best way to learn is to teach it to someone. Platonia allows one to organize one-on-one meetups with people for learning-and-teaching. Give it a try! Here's the [download link for iOS]((http://itunes.com/apps/platonia)) and here's the [download link for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.platonia_client). -->

<!-- - **Teaching:**  I am interested in teaching or mentoring opportunies in philosophy, algorithms, and creative writing.

- **Learning:** I am looking for people interested in practicing Improv, First Aid, or Wilderness survival skills.  

- **Creative Collaborations:** If you'd like to collaborate on something for *fun*, please don't hesitate to reach out. Here are some ideas: a podcast, a comedy sketch, a mobile app, or any long-form writing assignment.

**Contact**

I find a lot of value in mentoring. If you are a student applying for jobs or further studies, a new grad looking for career advice, or an entepreneur working on a startup, please don't hesitate to write to me.

<!-- My long-term project, [Platonia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.platonialabs.platonia), can now be downloaded on Google playstore. One of the best way to learn is to teach it to someone. Platonia allows you to organize one-on-one meetups with people near you for learning-and-teaching. -->
**Educational Background**

I read for a second BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford.  I was supported by the KC Mahindra Scholarship, [Tiara Special Grant](https://www.tiarafoundation.com/copy-of-tiara-special-grant), and a second undergraduate degree scholarship by Harris Manchester College.

Before Oxford, I graduated from [IIT Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Delhi) with a five-year Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Computing in 2013. My [master's thesis]([link to my thesis][thesis]) was in the design of approximation algorithms for networks under [Naveen Garg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen_Garg).

**I enjoy learning, teaching, and creative collaborations.**

- **Teaching:**  I am interested in teaching or mentoring opportunies in philosophy, algorithms, and creative writing.

- **Learning:** I am looking for people interested in practicing Improv, First Aid, or Wilderness survival skills.  

- **Creative Collaborations:** If you'd like to collaborate on something for *fun*, please don't hesitate to reach out. My notebooks are positively overflowing with ideas; it would be great to riff-off each other. Specifically, the mediums I am interested in are podcasts, sketch comedy and software (including mobile apps).

<p>Refuse to use the word â€œthing.â€</p>

<p>Each thing can be described in more detail. When we donâ€™t weâ€™re just being lazy. Donâ€™t drown the cake in frosting to avoid baking a new one.</p>

<p>Let a device be a device, a trait be a trait, a feeling be a feeling.</p>

<p>Before: â€œThis is the greatest thing my parents taught me.â€</p>

<p>After: â€œThis is the greatest lesson my parents taught me.â€</p>

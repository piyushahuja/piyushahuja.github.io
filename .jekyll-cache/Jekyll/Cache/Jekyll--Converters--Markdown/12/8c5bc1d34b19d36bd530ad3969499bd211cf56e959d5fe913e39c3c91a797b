<p>People mount /dev/log into a container, or send logs to logger daemon or /dev/null. You probably want to store logs externally: in a volume or mounted host directory, and have a separate container take care of logs.
Or use Log Rotate.</p>

<p>Containers are no vmâ€™s, if you have to log in on a container running in production - youâ€™re doing something wrong - unless that containerâ€™s only job is running SSH (which can be useful for example for Jenkins build slaves).</p>

<p>vs</p>

<p>The SSH server is incredibly useful for diagnosing problems in production, so I for one applaud it (although itâ€™s not really necessary anymore with docker exec).</p>

<p>Cron - again - same thing: run in a separate container and give access to the exact things your cronjob needs.</p>

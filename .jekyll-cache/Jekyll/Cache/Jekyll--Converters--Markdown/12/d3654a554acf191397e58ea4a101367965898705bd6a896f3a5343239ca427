I"C<p>Many jokes about afterlife go like this: a deceased person is given a preliminary tour of heaven and hell. Life in heaven, at the outset, seems so-so, a bit boring, a little undramatic. Hell, against all his expectations, turns out to be the stuff of dreams: a place where gorgeous women serves him strawberries and wine while he sunbathes on picturesque white beaches. The deceased is then given a choice as to where to spend the rest of his afterlife; and without a second thought, as you might guess, he chooses Hell.  The next thing he knows,  he finds himself shackled in chains, getting tortured in burning flames while demons mutilate his genitals with pitchforks.  Usually this is part of a bigger joke or moral lesson, but the micro-lesson is this: appearances are deceptive, and our choices in life have consequences.</p>

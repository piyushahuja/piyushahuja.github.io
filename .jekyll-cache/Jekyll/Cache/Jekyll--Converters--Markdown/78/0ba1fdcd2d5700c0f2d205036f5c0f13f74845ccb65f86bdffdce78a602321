I"<p>All of us have an immediate grasp of what ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù feels, a faculty as elemental as sight or touch, and just as readily available to us. When Descartes proclaimed ‚ÄúI think, therefore I am,‚Äù he established reasoning as foundational, the one undeniable truth.</p>

<!-- Reasoning is applied in everyday life in all sorts of informal ways.  There are many forms of reasoning: moral, legal, scientific, strategic, algorithmic, diagrammatic, visual, spatial. Different domains call for different types of reasoning, and the rules are not the same.  -->

<p>There are broadly two kinds of reasoning: deductive and inductive.</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<p>Suppose all swans are white.<br />
Suppose you hear a bird, and it is a swan.<br />
Therefore, you conclude that this bird is white.</p>

<p>This is deduction: from general rules (premises), we derive certain conclusions. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.</p>

<p>Formal logic codifies deductive reasoning, with a formal language (symbols, syntax), rules of inference (what transformations preserve truth) and semantics (interpretations assigning truth-values).  In the history of evolution of ideas, one can draw a direct line from Aristotle, who first studied formal logic, to Frege to Russell to Wittgenstein to Turing and Von Neumman. The foundation of classical computing, thus, are based on laws of deductive reasoning, laws that are a consequence of the structure of language, laws that govern the science of symbols.</p>

<p>Now consider the following:</p>

<p>Suppose you observe many swans, and every swan you have ever seen is white.
You conclude: ‚ÄúAll swans are white.‚Äù</p>

<p>This is induction: from specific observed cases, you infer a general rule - even though there is always the possibility of a black swan you haven‚Äôt seen yet.</p>

<p>Inductive reasoning allows us to generalize from experience, forming broader expectations and making predictions about future or unseen cases based on patterns in the data we have observed.</p>

<p>With ML, we have, for the very first time, synthesized a very good inductive reasoner. This is a big deal because an inductive reasoner can observe, think, learn and deal with  reality (the world of senses, the world of empiricism, the world of becoming) in a way a classical computer or a deductive reasoner can never.</p>

<p>How does it all work?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Through probability, we model the world as a dynamic entity where many possible worlds are possible, where events unfold, and as we observe what happens alternative realities are destroyed.</li>
  <li>We find laws that govern reasoning about uncertainty and information in this world.</li>
  <li>Learning from experience is about reducing our surprise about what happens in the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>Classical Computing was the end product deductive reasoning, based on a logic that deals with the symbols and the structure of language and relation between propositions. It has little to do with the real world, which is dynamic, transient, evolving, uncertain.</p>

  <li><strong>Prevent them from abandoning the app</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A set of clearly outlined steps to completion/registration is key. The more structured and clear the remaining time and number of steps remaining are, the more likely a user will be patient enough to go through and complete all of the steps required to get through the FTUE. “uncertain, unexplained waits feel longer than known, finite waits.”</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Communicate your key value proposition in their heads</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Teach them how to use the app.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Make them go “wow”</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Wow is achieved when a user recognizes, either quite actively or subconsciously, that your product or service is a must have experience that will improve her life. It’s something powerful enough to make users say, <em>“Wow, this is awesome.”</em></p>

<p>Some things to keep in mind about WOW factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’re often not a feature. But rather, what that feature makes possible.</li>
  <li>They convey much more value than effort required - (i.e. they are Low Effort, High Value activities)</li>
  <li>They are powerful when communicated with examples or analogies, but even more powerful when the result of real user interaction. Do &gt; Show &gt; Tell.</li>
</ul>

<p>Jarod Lanier points out our tendency “reduce ourselves” in order to make our description of them appear more accurate, “information underrepresents reality”</p>

<p>Whitman says “I am large, I contain multitudes”.</p>

<p>And Nietzche has an answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can man know himself?… For the most important inquiry, however, there is a method. Let the young soul survey its own life with a view of the following question: “What have you truly loved thus far? What has ever uplifted your soul, what has dominated and delighted it at the same time?” Assemble these revered objects in a row before you and perhaps they will reveal a law by their nature and their order: the fundamental law of your very self. Compare these objects, see how they complement, enlarge, outdo, transfigure one another; how they form a ladder on whose steps you have been climbing up to yourself so far; for your true self does not lie buried deep within you, but rather rises immeasurably high above you, or at least above what you commonly take to be your I.</p>

<p>This is how most people see me.</p>

<p>physical appearance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eyes: kind eyes that show plenty of care and love, a sparkle or a twinkle.</li>
  <li>voice: deep and resonant.</li>
  <li>smile:  warm, playful, and mischievous.</li>
  <li>my facial skin has some scars</li>
  <li>people often detect an underlying sadness in my expressions</li>
</ul>

<p>These are my most salient virtues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>wisdom, thoughtfulness and intelligence</li>
  <li>humour, playfulness, wit</li>
  <li>genuineness, integrity, honesty and commitment to truth</li>
  <li>curiosity, inquisitiveness</li>
  <li>kindness, care and warmth</li>
  <li>generosity</li>
  <li>openness</li>
</ul>

I"ë<p>â€œI have a trick that I used in my studio, because I have these twenty-eight-hundred-odd pieces of unreleased music, and I have them all stored in iTunes,â€ Eno said during his talk at Red Bull. â€œWhen Iâ€™m cleaning up the studio, which I do quite oftenâ€”and itâ€™s quite a big studioâ€”I just have it playing on random shuffle. And so, suddenly, I hear something and often I canâ€™t even remember doing it. Or I have a very vague memory of it, because a lot of these pieces, theyâ€™re just something I started at half past eight one evening and then finished at quarter past ten, gave some kind of funny name to that doesnâ€™t describe anything, and then completely forgot about, and then, years later, on the random shuffle, this thing comes up, and I think, Wow, I didnâ€™t hear it when I was doing it. And I think that often happensâ€”we donâ€™t actually hear what weâ€™re doing.Â .Â .Â . I often find pieces and I think, This is genius. Which me did that? Who was the me that did that?</p>

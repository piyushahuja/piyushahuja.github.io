I"”<p>The same goes for the situations many find themselves in where they donâ€™t want to speak their experience because they are looking for the right thing to say. In those cases an expression could be â€œI am looking for the right thing to say.â€</p>

<p>There is often great potential in sharing both the immediate reaction â€œI feel angryâ€ and the fear or sense of holding back that is present in the situation â€œI feel angry AND I am afraid of bringing it, because it feels like someone is going to attack me nowâ€.</p>

<p>â€œI am feeling provoked by what you are saying AND I am afraid of taking up space, because I can see that Y is in the middle of something important AND it feels important for me to bring all of this now AND saying this I both feel empowered and a bit shy.â€ Circling thus revolves around noticing what is going on in the present moment and sharing (WHAT I am experiencing and HOW I experience it ) or moving from there. The focus is on what is present right now, in us and between us. Even if we circle on a specific theme (i.e. â€œour business plan for 2020â€) we would focus on how we relate to it in this very moment and what it does to how we relate.</p>

<p>It is also about focusing on my body-being to see if there is anything that wants to be seen or heard rather than explaining why a discomfort or resistance is there (â€maybe this resistance can teach me something that I havenâ€™t realized yetâ€) and moving from vagueness to clear transmissions of that which deeply matters, although this often feels uncomfortable. Revealing ambivalence can be part of this (â€I am feeling fear, but I also seem to like what you are sayingâ€).</p>

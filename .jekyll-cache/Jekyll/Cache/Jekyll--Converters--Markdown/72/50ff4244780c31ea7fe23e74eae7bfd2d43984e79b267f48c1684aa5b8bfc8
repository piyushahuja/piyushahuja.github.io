The Social Network, Eternal Sunshine on the Spotless Mind, Carol,  The Truman Show, Proof, Blade Runner, Starter For Ten, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Catch Me If You Can.</p>

  <li>authentic middle-class family relationships (An Education, Almost Famous, A Separation, Taare Zameen Par, Fantastic Mr. Fox)</li>
  <li>meritocratic rise of an underdog (Contact, Finding Forrester, Forrest Gump, La La Land, Proof, A Beautiful Mind, Goal).</li>
  <li>space travel (Contact, Interstellar, Gravity)</li>
  <li>death and the human condition (The Fountain, The Man From Earth)</li>

I",<p>The typical hero’s journey starts with an individual who is living a sheltered, particularly unremarkable life. This life is interrupted by a calling - to go on an adventure or to resolve a conflict. His first instinct is to refuse the calling. He wonders whether he is fit to adequately answer it. He fears the unknown. He feels a sense of attachment to his present life.  But then, with the nudge of a mentor, and the moral support of companions, he is able to overcome these (mostly psychological) barriers and embark on the quest. At some point he crosses a first threshold, leaving the limits of his known world and venturing into an unknown territory, eventually reaching the  stage of separation from the hero’s known world and self. At this final stage, the hero goes through a metamorphosis.</p>

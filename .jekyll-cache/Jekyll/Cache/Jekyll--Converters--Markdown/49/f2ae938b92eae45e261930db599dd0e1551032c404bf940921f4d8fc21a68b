I"ÿ<p>Rafael Nadal announced his retirement this month, and I want to take this moment to reflect on what made him special.</p>

<hr />

<p>Some people light up your eyes by their very presence. They expand your idea of what it is possible to be. When he first appeared on the circuit, there wasnâ€™t anyone remotely like him.  <a href="https://x.com/troublefault/status/1847695446434525482">â€œHow beautifully bonkers it was when this loco kid in pirate pants showed up &amp; started bludgeoning everyone off the courtâ€</a>, as one Twitter user put it.</p>

<p>Nadal taught federer humility. During that tennis era, Federer felt invincible, and he acted like the role of tennis royalty. He carried himself with class. In his interviews and his demeanour, Federer came off as if he believed that him winning was a foregone conclusion, he was destined for greatness, and him losing was an affront against the laws of nature. His movement was said to be â€œgracefulâ€ and his tennis â€œeffortlesss.â€</p>

<p>Nadalâ€™s tennis, on the other hand, was as effortful as ones can be. He would chase down to retreieve balls that most players would give up on.</p>

The problem with being Elon Musk is that he has no more green grass to chase, so imagines that grass on Mars.

The good thing about chasing the grass is greener on the other side is that it makes you chase, travel on roads to cities with skyscrapers, rather than be self satisfied in your little village tending to cows.

The wisdom is that not that the grass is not greener on the other side, that is is just as green on your side, but that grass can be grown where is ground for it to grow and willingness on your part, and that is more fulfilling than any grass consuming you can do, and the task of man. 

The real treasure is the friends

You were supposed to water the grass on your side, instead of chasing the greener one.

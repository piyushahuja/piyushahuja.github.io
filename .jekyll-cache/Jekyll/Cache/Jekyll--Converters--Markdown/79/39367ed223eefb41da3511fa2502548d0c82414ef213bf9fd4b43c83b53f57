I"%X<p>How do we know what the sun, the stars and the moon are?</p>

<p>Raw observations. The sun is this yellow circle that comes up at one end of the horizon, traverses the sky, and then then goes down at the other end. We know that we only get light when this yellow circle is up, so the yellow circle is probably causing the light.</p>

<p>And then, when this yellow circle goes down, another circle is up in the sky,yellowish, along with tiny white dots. The other circle also moves around in one direction, and then sets, while the tiny dots stay the same, more or less.</p>

<p>And then the same thing happens again and again. The sun is always of the same size, but sometimes it takes longer to traverse the sky, sometimes lesser. And the other yellowish circle is not always a circle: it varies shape from being completely black to complety yellow. And the fixed white dots are not all fixed: some “wander”.</p>

<p>So there is some regularity, some periodicity, a pattern to the whole game.</p>

<p>It endows it with predictability.   And early humans had thousands of years and lots of time on their hands to observe the patterns, the patterns of the length of the days, the pattern of seasons etc. An understanding of these patterns was of great importance: predicting the seasons allowed early humans to decide when to sow or harvest their crops, take shelter from adverse weather conditions, and when to hold their ceremonies.</p>

<p>An early human would find these things to be true:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the moon is on the opposite side of the sun, it is fully illuminated.</li>
</ul>

<p>The moon’s phases, Anaxagoras realized, were the result of different portions of the celestial object being illuminated by the sun from Earth’s perspective.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Earth is floating freely and does not need to be resting on something (Anaximander)</li>
  <li>Sun is another natural body, on fire (Anaxagoras)</li>
  <li>Moon is a rock that reflect’s the light of the Sun (Anaxagoras)</li>
  <li>Bruno: first modern to say that the planets shined by reflecting light</li>
  <li>Stars are distant suns</li>
  <li>That Earth is spherical, not flat</li>
  <li>Measuring the circumference</li>

<p>(Wrong) Anaximander’s Model:</p>

<p>Anaximander was the first to conceive a mechanical model of the world.</p>

<p>In his model, the Earth floats very still in the centre of the infinite, not supported by anything. It remains “in the same place because of its indifference”, a point of view that Aristotle considered ingenious, but false, in On the Heavens. Anaximander’s realization that the Earth floats free without falling and does not need to be resting on something has been indicated by many as the first cosmological revolution and the starting point of scientific thinking. Karl Popper calls this idea “one of the boldest, most revolutionary, and most portentous ideas in the whole history of human thinking.”[46] Such a model allowed the concept that celestial bodies could pass under the Earth, opening the way to Greek astronomy.</p>

<p>Its curious shape is that of a cylinder[43] with a height one-third of its diameter. The flat top forms the inhabited world, which is surrounded by a circular oceanic mass.</p>

<p>In the 6th century BC, Anaximander proposed a cosmology with Earth shaped like a section of a pillar (a cylinder), held aloft at the center of everything. The Sun, Moon, and planets were holes in invisible wheels surrounding Earth; through the holes, humans could see concealed fire.</p>

<p>Aristarchus proposed Heliocentricsm as a hypothesis, but no one took him up, until Copernicus reviced the theory in 16th century</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What Moon Is</strong></p>

<p>Anaxagoras turns the problem of lunar light into a problem of geometry. When the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth than the sun, the full face is illuminated. The moon’s phases, Anaxagoras realized, must be the result of different portions of the celestial object being illuminated by the sun from Earth’s perspective. The philosopher also realized that the occasional darkening of the moon must result from the moon, sun and Earth lining up such that the moon passes into the Earth’s shadow—a lunar eclipse. When the moon passes directly in front of the sun, the skies darken during the day, a phenomenon Anaxagoras also described and we now call a solar eclipse.</p>

<p><strong>What Stars Are</strong></p>

<p><strong>Argument against heliocentrism</strong></p>

<p>The fact that stellar parallax was so small that it was unobservable at the time was used as the main scientific argument against heliocentrism during the early modern age. It is clear from Euclid’s geometry that the effect would be undetectable if the stars were far enough away, but for various reasons such gigantic distances involved seemed entirely implausible: it was one of Tycho’s principal objections to Copernican heliocentrism that in order for it to be compatible with the lack of observable stellar parallax, there would have to be an enormous and unlikely void between the orbit of Saturn (then the most distant known planet) and the eighth sphere (the fixed stars)</p>

<p><strong>Inaccurate measurements of the distance of the moon and the sun</strong>
I THINK your questioner has his Greeks in a twist. Aristarchus of Samos is now best known for his anticipation of Copernicus’ heliocentric (sun-centred) cosmology rather than for measuring the circumference of the earth, though he did estimate the distances to, and sizes of, the sun and moon - alas, rather inaccurately! The first circumference measurement of which we have a reasonably full account is the one made by Eratosthenes, librarian at Alexandria, sometime during the third century BC. He measured the angle between the rays of the midday sun and a vertical post in Alexandria on a day when the sun was directly overhead at Syene (near Aswan), 5,000 “stades” due south of Alexandria, and found the angle to be (about) a fiftieth of a full circle (7= degrees). If 5,000 stades corresponds to a fiftieth of the circumference, then the whole circumference must be (5,000:50), or 250,000 stades. Unfortunately, the figures we have are rounded, and we do not know the exact length of his unit, the stade. However, modern consensus suggests that his figure was probably a few per cent low - still, not bad for an astronomical measurement made with a stick.</p>

<p><strong>That the earth’s tilted axis itself rotates!</strong></p>

<p>The discovery of precession usually is attributed to Hipparchus (190–120 BC) of Rhodes or Nicaea, a Greek astronomer. According to Ptolemy’s Almagest, Hipparchus measured the longitude of Spica and other bright stars. Comparing his measurements with data from his predecessors, Timocharis (320–260 BC) and Aristillus (~280 BC), he concluded that Spica had moved 2° relative to the autumnal equinox. He also compared the lengths of the tropical year (the time it takes the Sun to return to an equinox) and the sidereal year (the time it takes the Sun to return to a fixed star), and found a slight discrepancy. Hipparchus concluded that the equinoxes were moving (“precessing”) through the zodiac, and that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century, in other words, completing a full cycle in no more than 36000 years.</p>

<p>Hipparchus gave an account of his discovery in On the Displacement of the Solsticial and Equinoctial Points (described in Almagest III.1 and VII.2). He measured the ecliptic longitude of the star Spica during lunar eclipses and found that it was about 6° west of the autumnal equinox. By comparing his own measurements with those of Timocharis of Alexandria (a contemporary of Euclid, who worked with Aristillus early in the 3rd century BC), he found that Spica’s longitude had decreased by about 2° in the meantime (exact years are not mentioned in Almagest). Also in VII.2, Ptolemy gives more precise observations of two stars, including Spica and concludes that in each case a 2°:40’ change occurred between 128 BC and AD 139 (hence, 1° per century or one full cycle in 36000 years, that is, the precessional period of Hipparchus as reported by Ptolemy ; cf. page 328 in Toomer’s translation of Almagest, 1998 edition)). He also noticed this motion in other stars. He speculated that only the stars near the zodiac shifted over time. Ptolemy called this his “first hypothesis” (Almagest VII.1), but did not report any later hypothesis Hipparchus might have devised. Hipparchus apparently limited his speculations, because he had only a few older observations, which were not very reliable.</p>

<p>Because the equinoctial points are not marked in the sky, Hipparchus needed the Moon as a reference point; he used a lunar eclipse to measure the position of a star. Hipparchus already had developed a way to calculate the longitude of the Sun at any moment. A lunar eclipse happens during Full moon, when the Moon is at opposition, precisely 180° from the Sun. Hipparchus is thought to have measured the longitudinal arc separating Spica from the Moon. To this value, he added the calculated longitude of the Sun, plus 180° for the longitude of the Moon. He did the same procedure with Timocharis’ data (Evans 1998, p. 251). Observations such as these eclipses, incidentally, are the main source of data about when Hipparchus worked, since other biographical information about him is minimal. The lunar eclipses he observed, for instance, took place on 21 April 146 BC, and 21 March 135 BC (Toomer 1984, p. 135 n. 14).</p>

<p>Hipparchus also studied precession in On the Length of the Year. Two kinds of year are relevant to understanding his work. The tropical year is the length of time that the Sun, as viewed from the Earth, takes to return to the same position along the ecliptic (its path among the stars on the celestial sphere). The sidereal year is the length of time that the Sun takes to return to the same position with respect to the stars of the celestial sphere. Precession causes the stars to change their longitude slightly each year, so the sidereal year is longer than the tropical year. Using observations of the equinoxes and solstices, Hipparchus found that the length of the tropical year was 365+1/4−1/300 days, or 365.24667 days (Evans 1998, p. 209). Comparing this with the length of the sidereal year, he calculated that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century. From this information, it is possible to calculate that his value for the sidereal year was 365+1/4+1/144 days (Toomer 1978, p. 218). By giving a minimum rate, he may have been allowing for errors in observation.</p>

<p>To approximate his tropical year Hipparchus created his own lunisolar calendar by modifying those of Meton and Callippus in On Intercalary Months and Days (now lost), as described by Ptolemy in the Almagest III.1 (Toomer 1984, p. 139). The Babylonian calendar used a cycle of 235 lunar months in 19 years since 499 BC (with only three exceptions before 380 BC), but it did not use a specified number of days. The Metonic cycle (432 BC) assigned 6,940 days to these 19 years producing an average year of 365+1/4+1/76 or 365.26316 days. The Callippic cycle (330 BC) dropped one day from four Metonic cycles (76 years) for an average year of 365+1/4 or 365.25 days. Hipparchus dropped one more day from four Callippic cycles (304 years), creating the Hipparchic cycle with an average year of 365+1/4−1/304 or 365.24671 days, which was close to his tropical year of 365+1/4−1/300 or 365.24667 days.</p>

<p>Hipparchus’s mathematical signatures are found in the Antikythera Mechanism, an ancient astronomical computer of the second century BC. The mechanism is based on a solar year, the Metonic Cycle, which is the period the Moon reappears in the same place in the sky with the same phase (full Moon appears at the same position in the sky approximately in 19 years), the Callipic cycle (which is four Metonic cycles and more accurate), the Saros cycle and the Exeligmos cycles (three Saros cycles for the accurate eclipse prediction). The study of the Antikythera Mechanism proves that the ancients have been using very accurate calendars based on all the aspects of solar and lunar motion in the sky. In fact, the Lunar Mechanism which is part of the Antikythera Mechanism depicts the motion of the Moon and its phase, for a given time, using a train of four gears with a pin and slot device which gives a variable lunar velocity that is very close to the second law of Kepler, i.e. it takes into account the fast motion of the Moon at perigee and slower motion at apogee. This discovery proves that Hipparchus mathematics were much more advanced than Ptolemy describes in his books, as it is evident that he developed a good approximation of Kepler’s second law.</p>

<p>The first astronomer known to have continued Hipparchus’s work on precession is Ptolemy in the second century AD. Ptolemy measured the longitudes of Regulus, Spica, and other bright stars with a variation of Hipparchus’s lunar method that did not require eclipses. Before sunset, he measured the longitudinal arc separating the Moon from the Sun. Then, after sunset, he measured the arc from the Moon to the star. He used Hipparchus’s model to calculate the Sun’s longitude, and made corrections for the Moon’s motion and its parallax (Evans 1998, pp. 251–255). Ptolemy compared his own observations with those made by Hipparchus, Menelaus of Alexandria, Timocharis, and Agrippa. He found that between Hipparchus’s time and his own (about 265 years), the stars had moved 2°40’, or 1° in 100 years (36” per year; the rate accepted today is about 50” per year or 1° in 72 years). It is possible, however, that Ptolemy simply trusted Hipparchus’ figure instead of making his own measurements. He also confirmed that precession affected all fixed stars, not just those near the ecliptic, and his cycle had the same period of 36,000 years as found by Hipparchus</p>

<p>Most ancient authors did not mention precession and, perhaps, did not know of it. For instance, Proclus rejected precession, while Theon of Alexandria, a commentator on Ptolemy in the fourth century, accepted Ptolemy’s explanation. Theon also reports an alternate theory:</p>

<p>According to certain opinions ancient astrologers believe that from a certain epoch the solstitial signs have a motion of 8° in the order of the signs, after which they go back the same amount. . . . (Dreyer 1958, p. 204)
Instead of proceeding through the entire sequence of the zodiac, the equinoxes “trepidated” back and forth over an arc of 8°. The theory of trepidation is presented by Theon as an alternative to precession.</p>

<p><strong>Rotation of the earth</strong></p>

<p>First of all, the rotation of the Earth could have been proven using an experiment similar to Foucault’s pendulum. There is nothing in Léon Foucault’s 1851 experiment which could not have been done in 1581 ,or 1081, or 581 or even 81 CE. They just didn’t think of it — and they did not study pendulums very carefully before Galileo. They could have, but they didn’t.</p>

<p><strong>The Curvature Of The Earth</strong></p>

<p>How do we know that the Earth curves?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Early phoenician sailors saw the changing latitude of pole star and area of the the stars surrounding it as they travelled south of Mediteranneon.</li>
  <li>Aristotle observed there are stars seen in Egypt and Cyprus that are not seen in northerly regions. This could only happen on a curved surface.</li>
  <li>Travellers going south would see southern constellations rise- The shadow of Earth on the Moon during a lunar enculpes.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Some scholars follow Frances Yates in stressing the importance of Bruno’s ideas about the universe being infinite and lacking geocentric structure as a crucial crossing point between the old and the new. According to astrophysicist Steven Soter, he was the first person to grasp that “stars are other suns with their own planets.”[74] Others see in Bruno’s idea of multiple worlds instantiating the infinite possibilities of a pristine, indivisible One,[76] a forerunner of Everett’s many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.[77]</p>

<p>The principle of relativity states that it is impossible to determine whether a system is at rest or moving at constant speed with respect to an inertial system by experiments internal to the system, i.e., there is no internal observation by
which one can distinguish a system moving uniformly from one at rest. This principle played a key role in the defence of the heliocentric system, as it made the movement of the Earth compatible with everyday experience. https://web.archive.org/web/20160126194011/http://www.narit.or.th/en/files/2015JAHHvol18/2015JAHH…18..241D.pdf</p>

<p>In particular, to support the Copernican view and oppose the objection according to which the motion of the Earth would be perceived by means of the motion of winds, clouds etc., in La Cena de le Ceneri Bruno anticipates some of the arguments of Galilei on the relativity principle.[70] Note that he also uses the example now known as Galileo’s ship.</p>

<p>Theophilus – […] air through which the clouds and winds move are parts of the Earth, […] to mean under the name of Earth the whole machinery and the entire animated part, which consists of dissimilar parts; so that the rivers, the rocks, the seas, the whole vaporous and turbulent air, which is enclosed within the highest mountains, should belong to the Earth as its members, just as the air [does] in the lungs and in other cavities of animals by which they breathe, widen their arteries, and other similar effects necessary for life are performed. The clouds, too, move through accidents in the body of the Earth and are in its bowels as are the waters. […] With the Earth move […] all things that are on the Earth. If, therefore, from a point outside the Earth something were thrown upon the Earth, it would lose, because of the latter’s motion, its straightness as would be seen on the ship […] moving along a river, if someone on point C of the riverbank were to throw a stone along a straight line, and would see the stone miss its target by the amount of the velocity of the ship’s motion. But if someone were placed high on the mast of that ship, move as it may however fast, he would not miss his target at all, so that the stone or some other heavy thing thrown downward would not come along a straight line from the point E which is at the top of the mast, or cage, to the point D which is at the bottom of the mast, or at some point in the bowels and body of the ship. Thus, if from the point D to the point E someone who is inside the ship would throw a stone straight up, it would return to the bottom along the same line however far the ship moved, provided it was not subject to any pitch and roll.”[71]</p>

<hr />

<p>The idea that some invisible unknown force is acting upon entities far away is rather a magical idea if you think about it.</p>

<p>The idea that the position of the moon influences events on earth sounds just like astrology as it does physics. The only difference is that the claim by physics can be replicated while the one by astrology cannot. But both are equally mystical.</p>

<p>Modern chemistry was born out of european alchemists primarily trying to reproduce porcelain from china - a major source of trade imbalance between china and europe.</p>

<p>Thales or Parmenides was the first to realize that the morning star and the evening star are the same (Venus).</p>

<p>The work of Galileo Galilei in the application of the telescope to astronomical observation met with rejection from influential sceptics. They denied the truth of his most startling reports, such as that there were mountains on the moon and satellites around Jupiter.</p>

<p>Lunar mountains that cast shadows varying consistently with the direction of Solar illumination.</p>

<p>Two of the more entertaining parts of the shape-of-the-Earth story: (1) It was common at one time to argue that humans couldn’t live at the equator; and (2) skepticism that people could live at the antipodes, particularly amusing to this Australian</p>

I"ž<CENTER><h1 class="emphnext">Things I Love</h1></CENTER>

<p>Iâ€™m always hesitate to share such lists: would I continue loving the things I love now, or would it change? Do the things I love say something about my essence, or are they a result of whim, chance and happenstance?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the things we love can reveal aspects of our interior lives  in a way that any biography or self-description cannot. They fill me with a sense of freedom and possibility and expansiveness.</p>

I"A<p>The idea: This is a rewiring of the patterns that can keep me stuck in thought loops. rewrite limiting beliefs and embody new ones.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Find Limiting Belief The inner critic tends to be harsher. Replace it with something that is true-er to reality.  Is it really true? Get the sting out, not darkly pessimistic.
    <ul>
      <li>Learning from resistance and releasing it It is also about focusing on my body-being to see if there is anything that wants to be seen or heard rather than explaining why a discomfort or resistance is there (”maybe this resistance can teach me something that I haven’t realized yet”) and moving from vagueness to clear transmissions of that which deeply matters, although this often feels uncomfortable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Rewrite Replace the inner critic with a fact.  The statement should be about the present, not something that you want or in the future. (Circling revolves around noticing what is going on in the present moment and sharing (WHAT I am experiencing and HOW I experience it ) or moving from there. The focus is on what is present right now, in us and between us. Even if we circle on a specific theme (i.e. “our business plan for 2020”) we would focus on how we relate to it in this very moment and what it does to how we relate.)</li>
  <li>And Embrace the resistance. It sets the energy free.
    <ul>
      <li>“And I was noticing these young cynical, jaded atheistic shut down mechanisms kicking off, I accepted this and welcomed those resistances as a part of my ride.  - James Buchanan</li>
      <li>Searching for the beloved in those moments looked like a deep acceptance of myself and the situation in that instant. Yes to my resistance yes to my stuckness, yes to my confusion, yes to the tyranny of my personality. “ I cannot shame myself into change, I can only love myself into evolution” (Laura on saying Yes to Resistance == Deep accceptance in that instant)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Embody: Gently embrace the whole statement. Let the sentences sink in your heart, befriends the feelings.</li>
</ul>

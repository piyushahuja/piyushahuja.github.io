I"<p>RL methods follow two general ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Value Based: We could estimate how “good” a state or state/action pair is, and then we could have our agent behave greedily.</li>
  <li>Policy Based: We could find an optimal policy, a policy being a function that outputs an action for each state. 
These model and optimize the policy directly (rather than indirectly). The value of the reward (objective) function depends on this policy and then various algorithms can be applied to optimize for the best reward.</li>
</ul>

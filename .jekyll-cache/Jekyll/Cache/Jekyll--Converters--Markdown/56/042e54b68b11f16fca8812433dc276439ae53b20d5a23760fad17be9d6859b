I"X<p><strong>The Initiation</strong></p>

<p>I experienced the touch of the divine feminine. I felt loved. By three people. I saw this vision: it was the dawn of civilization. I was an one of the early men. I was Purush. I was Adam.  The land was densely forested, possibly Ancient India. I was unclothed. I saw myself as a spiritual light.</p>

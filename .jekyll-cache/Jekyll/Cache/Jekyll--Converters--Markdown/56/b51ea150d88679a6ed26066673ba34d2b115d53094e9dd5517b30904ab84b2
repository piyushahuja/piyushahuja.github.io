I"×)<p>The dress code was the easy bit. A dinner jacket needs to have silk lapels. Black Oxford shoes. The trousers had to be with silk seams.</p>

<p>The dress code was fixed, specific, clear.</p>

<p>The questions had a greater scope for flexibility. There were those that one is pretty much guaranteed to be asked: Where are you from? What do you do for work? What is your background?  How do you know the host?</p>

<p>One could answer in a straightforward manner, but thats rookie level boring. An unexpected but apt response to a frequently asked question is the mark of a seasoned socialite.</p>

<p>If someone asks where youâ€™re from, reformulate that question in your mind and make it more specific: â€œWhat brought you to where you are currently living?â€</p>

<p>â€œYes, Andâ€ was also a good template for moving the conversation forward.For example, an â€œIâ€™m goodâ€ reply to a â€œHow are you?â€ question puts a brake on the conversation, but if you add why youâ€™re good, â€œIâ€™m good. I just started a book (or podcast or TV show) and Iâ€™m really enjoying it. Have you heard of it?â€, or mention something where thereâ€™s a shared common experience: â€œIâ€™m good. They restocked the cold brew in the kitchen and itâ€™s so strong. Have you tried it?â€, it flows better.</p>

<p>It was good to have an elevator pitch that paints a picture of you that will stay in the personâ€™s head. All you need is at least one compelling character (you), a captivating theme, and some kind of narrative arc. Think about your life as a series of towns connected by a road, where the towns are the relevant parts of your background connected by your theme. Frankly, most people wonâ€™t remember the towns at all. Theyâ€™ll just viscerally remember whether the theme was compellingly supported. At a professional event, you want to give the other person a good idea of your skills, qualifications, and where youâ€™re looking to go in your career.</p>

<p>To start a conversation, bring out the small talk. The goal of small talk is to signal your interest in the other person and allowing them to signal interest or disinterest by how they respond. One does it by conventional openers: a frequently asked question would do (Howâ€™s it going? Soâ€¦what do you do for work?). Or by anchoring on something common. One can find a common anchor by observing the surroundings.Â The weather is always thereÂ  â€œNice weather weâ€™re havingâ€. Food, often present in a party, is also a unifying point.Â  One could have a rolodex of topics:Â  name, work, work, these days, the room. â€œWhat does your name mean? What would you like it to mean?â€ â€œWhatâ€™s your story?â€Â Â  â€œHowâ€™d you end up in your line of work?â€Â  â€œWhat did you do today?â€ â€œWhatâ€™s an interesting thing that happened at work today?â€â€œWhat was the best part of your weekend?â€ â€œWhat are you looking forward to this week?â€Â  â€œWho do you think is the luckiest person in this room?â€Â Â  â€œWhat does this house remind you of?â€Â   Once the conversations starts flowing, the goal isÂ to find better and more specific points of connection. A common friend - the host, for example.Â  If its someone you already have a past be, a memory you experienced together could be a great point of connection.Â For example, â€œHey, remember that time when we did X?Â  That was so fun!â€Â  The story of how you met can be particularly powerfully connecting, because it is, essentially, your origin story.</p>

<p>Once you find the common anchor, reveal something about yourself in relation to the anchor,Â  and encourage with a question. Â  It is in general better to ask questions that are open ended as opposed to closed. 
Paraphrasing is the swiss army knife of communication: allows you to reframe, or pause, or think about the answer. It also requires you to listen in the same way cooking requires you to taste and drawing requires you to see.</p>

<p>Discuss things you care about. A topic related to your professional field, for example, an article you saw or book you read. Or share something weird or interesting happen to you recently.Â </p>

<p>At the end of each topic or blurb, throw out a conversational spark.Â â€œ I canâ€™t believe they did that, what would you guys do in that situation?â€ â€œâ€¦what do you guys think? Would you rather A or B?â€Â â€œâ€¦If you got paid $1,000 would you do XYZ?â€</p>

<p>Ask questions about their work that you genuinely want answered. Ask them about the people they work with. Figure out who you knowÂ  in common. Say things like, â€œI hear that your school has started a new such-and-such program; is that something you were involved in?â€, or â€œSo-and-so from your group joined our faculty recently; nice person, interesting workâ€. If other people, projects, or laboratories come up in the conversation, say whatever positive things you honestly have to say about them.</p>

<p>Introduce other people Soon as you meet one person, introduce that person to the next personâ€”and add in a playful, â€œHey, have you met so-and-so?Â  We go way back.â€Â  When you introduce someone, donâ€™t just introduce them by name. Tell a story about them and praise them. People will love you for this and it creates a natural flow into a longer conversation. Buddy up One great way to make conversations easier is to pair up with a good friend when you chat with others. This way you have someone there that you can always lean on in case the new conversation doesnâ€™t flow that well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eliminate the dull droning on about facts and figures â€” whether itâ€™s snowing or raining, how cold it is, what we do for work, how long it takes to get to work, where we went to school â€” all those things that we think we have to talk about with someone new but that tell us little about who the person really is.Â Â  Donâ€™t confuse personal (â€œI like to travelâ€) with private (â€œIâ€™m in the middle of an inheritance disputeâ€). Donâ€™t gossip, bitch or complain. Avoid criticism, negativity,Â  and arguments. Donâ€™t try to argue with people â€˜just for the sake of itâ€™ or to â€˜test if they come up with good counter-pointsâ€™.Â Itâ€™s disrespectful. If you really want to talk about an issue in a debate format, express your desire and see whether the other person agrees or not. Do not pick up debates or arguments for the sake of intellectual discussion.Â  Donâ€™t let someone pin you down into a corner where you have to defend yourself. Continue keeping things light and a bit ridiculous and the air will change. You might even gain some respect. Keep a positive attitude (donâ€™t forget the smile) even when youâ€™re feeling attacked.Â  If you choose to stay, then you have to stay deft and keep the air light.Â </li>
  <li>Ask for their advice.Â â€¨People want to help others and feel like theyâ€™re making a difference. Asking for their input will make them feel more valuable in the conversation while simultaneously stroking their ego.
    <ul>
      <li>â€œYou know Greg, Iâ€™m supposed to plan a first date with this girl I really like but Iâ€™m afraid of screwing it up. Where do you like to take your dates?â€</li>
      <li>â€œSusan! That reminds me, do you have any nephews around the age of 7? Itâ€™s my nephews birthday next week and I havenâ€™t a clue what to get him.â€</li>
      <li>Honing your Ask Reality check: people are going to remember at most three things about you. Make sure one of them is your ask- the most impactful thing they can do to help you. To maximize your ask, make it short, clear, and a single step. Otherwise, it will be harder to remember and execute. Making asks is often uncomfortable for smart successful people - you want to get by on your own and be so awesome that people will figure out how to help you on your own. This is not going to happen. On the other hand, if you have a clear actionable ask, people are eager to jump on it. Years ago, whenever I would travel somewhere, I would passively post â€œIâ€™m going to be in town, who wants to hang out?â€ Maybe one or two people would respond if I was lucky. Now I actively ask friends who have lived there â€œwho are the best people you know there? Can you put me in touch with them?â€ The result? Friendships and adventures. Some good examples of asks:</li>
      <li>â€œIâ€™m looking to get in touch with people who are director level or above in the elder care industryâ€</li>
      <li>â€œI need a new apartment in San Francisco under $2200, preferably in the mission.</li>
      <li>â€œIâ€™m looking for customer-facing jobs in robotics that take advantage of my unique combination of technical skills and people skillsâ€</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you want to exit,Â non-verbally communicate the fact you want to say goodbye.Â Depending on the situation, you can do that by putting down your glass and moving away slightly â€“ or the opposite: you can move closer to your counterpart and lift your hand towards them as if to touch them, or actually touch them. It all depends on your relationship with the person youâ€™re talking to. Itâ€™s easier to say goodbye when you have the floorÂ than to wait for the other person to take a breath and then abruptly say, â€œIâ€™m going to go now, goodbye. if youÂ make reference to something that was discussed earlier in the conversation, you show your counterpart that youâ€™ve been listening and leave them with a good feeling. â€œIt was nice talking to you. I thought what you said about the documentary series was really interesting. I will definitely look into it. I have to go now, I hope you have a great evening.â€</li>
  <li>If you have to exit abruptly, keep a number of exit strategies in your bag of tricks and pull one of them. You have to get going. Someone is expecting you. You need to take a call.</li>
  <li>If you want to join a group, be prepared as to what to say when you have a chance to speak â€œI just heard you talking about good restaurants and thought: I definitely need to go introduce myself!â€Â  If you want to address someone directly, it is a good idea to look at the person for a while -Â  it redirects the focus of the group to that person and makes them feel like they are the centre of attention.</li>
  <li>Names. Care about names.Â  Repeat someoneâ€™s name right after they introduce themselves to me. Think of a celebrity that has the same name so that it helps my memory by association.  â€œRemind me of your name againâ€. Introduce them to someone else. Call over your friend Steve, turn back to the person you were speaking to and say, â€œThis is my friend Steve.â€ Pause. The other person will reveal his/her name to Steve and you will hear it.</li>
</ul>

I"A<blockquote>
  <p>There is no image you can hold
No thought you can think 
That encompasses the Great Self</p>

  <p>Your essence
is immortal and unchanging
Yet it is the foundations for all that moves</p>

  <p>Rest in the shimmering emptiness
That is the source of the world
And remember who you are</p>

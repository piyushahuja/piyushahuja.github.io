No thought you can think 
That encompasses the Great Self

Your essence

Yet it is the foundations for all that moves

Rest in the shimmering emptiness
That is the source of the world

<p>I have to be somewhere where I desire something. To get it, I have to be someone, so the thought goes. What is that someone?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I could be spiritual, like an stoic monk.</li>
  <li>I could be generous and giving, as if I were in service.</li>
  <li>I could be outspoken and attention-seeking.</li>
  <li>I could be vulnerable and speak my thoughts, often insecurities.</li>
  <li>I could be vulnerable and keep track of my feelings and vocalise them.</li>
  <li>I could be “in my power”, channel eros.</li>
  <li>I could be playful, as it provides comfort, flexibility and makes others feel safe.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

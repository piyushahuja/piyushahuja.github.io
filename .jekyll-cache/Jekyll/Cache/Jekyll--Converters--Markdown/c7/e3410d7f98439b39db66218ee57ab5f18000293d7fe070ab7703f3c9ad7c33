I"›<p>34 this month, and time to take stock once again. This juncture of life feels crucial in a way others werenâ€™t. It feels as if I am at a risky bend in the road, and if I donâ€™t maneuver it well, I could be forever derailed in many important areas of life: career, relationships, and family.  I am already late, but not too late, and this feels like a last chance: it will be too late after this bend.</p>

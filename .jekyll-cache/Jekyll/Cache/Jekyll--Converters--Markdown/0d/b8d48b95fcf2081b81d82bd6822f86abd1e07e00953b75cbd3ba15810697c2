<p>There is a “way of be” in the world that is tantric.</p>

<p>It is non-reactive and relaxed.
It feels effortless, free, in the “flow of life”, genuine, authentic, “in integrity”.
All emotions are welcome, including: fear, anger, sadness (to investigate: what about “stress”, “anxiety”, “nervousness”, “jealousy”). 
It has heightened awareness of your own emotions, your senses. 
You see reality “as is”, including the emotions of others. 
You have needs, but you are not “needy”. You are not in a “getting” state. 
You give freeily, but do not “give to get”.
You are able to play and take risks.</p>

<p>Often I criticize myself for not being socially savvy, for not being able to make small talk or have conversations with beautiful women. But the reason I feel uncomfortable to talk to certain woman have nothing to do with ability, but often about the cues that I have picked subconsciously picked up up on how the other person’s attitutde towards me.</p>

<p>Example: After the men-women reunion, I felt comfortable talking to Sarah, Kathy, Vanese, Stella, but not with Ingrid, Katie, etc. This was entirely due on them, and nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>It might be good to bring these cues to awareness, so that I communicate.</p>

<p>Erring on the side of asking for permission always works: “Would you be comfortable texting?” rather than assuming one way or the other. If i assume too much, I might signal i am not good at boundaries, or am intrusive. If I assume too less, I might miss out on connection where possibility of connection exists.</p>

<ul>
  <li>May I hold your hand?</li>
  <li>Would you be comfortable talking about sexual matters?</li>
  <li>Would you be open to texting?</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p>Truth is, I was in a very different state of mind and feeling when I started this journey than I am now. It is impossible to recall how I my internal experience of myself used to be, but I remember the facts clearly: I broke down in tears after Vanese’s initiation in LT1. Slowly at first, then violently when I realized that my beloved wouldnt not only look at me, but wouldnt even care for me. It felt pretty natural then, and was cathartic, but it was, in hindsight, what they call a “trauma response.”” I also got incredibly melancholic after the Men-Women reunion after LT1 in Florence House, after observing my beloved. Slowly at first, then back at the mattress.</p>

<p>Would I have the same reaction if the same series of events were to happen to me now?</p>

I"<p>Creative insights are not as rare; what is rare is the conviction and courage to act on them. Everyone has moments of insight. However, it is common for one to not listen to them; when faced with something original and real, the human instinct is to shy away, embracing the comfort and security of the tried-and-tested. Listening to your insight or intution is a practiced skill. If not practice, it is dulled - to the extent that one is not able to tell their own thoughts from those of others. Other peopleâ€™s ideas start feeling as if they are your own; compare, for example, the authentic metaphors of a poet to the cliched and conventional vocabulary of a suit.</p>

<p>To not act on your insights is as big a risk for entrepreneurs as not listening to their feelings is for artists or not to listen to their moral convictions for political reformers.</p>

<p>But within the domain of digital products, what do insights look like?</p>

<p>One is reminded of this iconic scene from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdjGiIn9HMM">The Social Network</a>. However, it doesnâ€™t have to be as dramatic as that. More veridically, Mark Zuckerberg talks about how people frequently changing their profile picture led to the insight that strong demand for a service that people could share more photos, which became a key differentiator and frquenly used feature. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bJi7k-y1Lo">Starting at 13:45</a>. Sharing photos on the social network might seem ubiquitious now, but it wasnâ€™t back in the early days.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of examples from Instagramâ€¦</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early on, there was a San Francisco Giants playoff game taking place at AT&amp;T Park, near the companyâ€™s offices. As Systrom recalls, this led to another aha moment: â€œWe were hearing the roars of home runs, not feeling like we were actually there,â€ he recalls. â€œWe did an ad hoc [search] within the database to see if anyone was using Instagram in the area, and there were 140 photos in the last two hours taken in the stadium, so we could see the game [through the app]. . . . And that was the moment we realized Instagram could be far more than photo sharing.â€</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a beach walk one day, Nicole told him she would be reluctant to use the app he was working on because her pictures would never be as good as the ones a mutual friend took. â€œI said, â€˜Well, you know what he does to those photos, right?â€™ Sheâ€™s like, â€˜No, he just takes good photos.â€™ Iâ€™m like, â€˜No, no, he puts them through filter apps.â€™ Sheâ€™s like, â€˜Well, you guys should probably have filters too, right, then?â€™ I was like, â€˜Huh.â€™ â€ â€œLike,â€ indeed. Systrom went back to his hotel room and scoured the Internet, trying to figure out how to make a filter. That day, he created the first, which he called X-Pro II, after the â€œcross-processing where you take the wrong chemicals for the wrong film and you put them together.â€ He and Nicole started taking pictures using the filter and posted the first Instagram photo in this unusual style of a little Mexican dog lying next to Nicoleâ€™s foot. Once they had the filters, they aimed to launch the new service in just eight weeks.</p>

<p>Insights could be quantitative and come from recording user behavior and data. Hereâ€™s a cute anecdote often told didactively in business school classes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œWhen they first built the University of California at Irvine they just put the buildings in. They did not put any sidewalks, they just planted grass. The next year, they came back and put the sidewalks where the trails were in the grass.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or they could be analytical, based on research:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œShaw put Bezos in charge of exploring new business opportunities in the burgeoning world of the Internet. It was while brainstorming ideas in the then-unfamiliar area of electronic commerce that Bezos came to his deceptively simple conclusion: The most logical thing to sell over the Internet was books, largely because two of the countryâ€™s largest book distributors already had exhaustive electronic lists.â€</p>

I"<p>Dear Self,</p>

<p>Youâ€™ve achieved a lot. Youâ€™ve graduated from IIT Delhi with a major in Maths and Computing. Youâ€™re now read Philosophy, Politics and Economics in only two years.  Youâ€™ve now experienced many things which were your lifelong dreams. Youâ€™ve seen Federer set the court alight at Wimbledon. Youâ€™ve watched the Auroras in Iceland, climbed volcanoes in Indonesia, and volunteered with a monastery in the Himalayas. Youâ€™ve rowed, wined and dined, croqueted, pimmed and punted.  All your family members are healthier and happier. You yourself are in the prime of your life, young and healthy. And you have designs and plans for the future which you feel passionately about.</p>

<p>But you are still not happy. Youâ€™re repeatedly frustrated by your own ambitions. Your writing hasnâ€™t taken off to match your expectations (It has! It is much much better than what it was before, and definitely better than those of others).  Your sense of humour has dipped. You are still not able to delight a crowd or be the centre of attraction among a group of friends. All this brings distress to you (quite apart from the fact that youâ€™ve never been all this). It seems (to you) that youâ€™ve lost one friend after the other since graduating from IIT Delhi. Youâ€™re missing a sense of community, and you want to feel loved, and respected (you do not need it!) .</p>

<p>And there are other, more serious matters to take care of. You sister is to be married and her life sorted. Dad has to rehabilitated somehow - despite himself. And something has to be done about your sad, tired, and old-looking countenance.</p>

<p>Two ingredients are essential to solve all your problems: self-love and presence.</p>

<p>You need to love yourself. Embrace (not ignore) all your flaws. You need to carry a narrative identity: a sense of self which is truly you  which doesnâ€™t make you ashamed to be who you are or afraid of things which you want to say. Know your own story; focus on positives; believe that youâ€™re interesting. Recollections, memories, anecdotes, your dayâ€™s story are all important.  When you tell your story, reincorporation is the key - not content, but structure. And yet you need to take yourself not-too seriously. What other people think is none of your business. You need brush aside negative judgements, appraisals, by others, or even by you. Speak boldly and assertively. There is a difference between self-love, which is calm and secure, and self-obsessive â€˜look at meâ€™ narcissism, which is a product of insecurity.</p>

<p>Second, you need to practise mindfulness - especially when interacting with others. Be very aware of things around you, instead of retreating into your head. Perceive. Improvise.</p>

<p>The rest is all about balance. There has to be a balance between being delusionaly flawless and spotting insecurities where there should be none. Between open hearted vulnerability and broadcasting your insecurities. Between you loving others and bending over backward for them. Between protecting your boundaries and being close minded (doing things to fit in, doing things to seem cool, eats at your self-esteem.  Learn to say No -  not just to people but to distracting thoughts as well).  Pursue stuff systematically and diligently, with conviction, confidence and calm. Cultivate a winning mentality, which makes you lead, suggest hypothesis, and make decisions for a group.  Be such that every person recommends you. Be bold and take responsibility.  Donâ€™t be intimidated by anyone - everyone is pretending.</p>

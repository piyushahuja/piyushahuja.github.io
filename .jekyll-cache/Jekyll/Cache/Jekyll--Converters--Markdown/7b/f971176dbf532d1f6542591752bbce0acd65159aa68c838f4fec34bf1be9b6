  <p>Certainly this man, notwithstanding his youth, understands the improvisation of life, and astonishes even the acutest observers. For it seems that he never makes a mistake, although he constantly plays the most hazardous games. One is reminded of the improvising masters of the musical art, to whom even the listeners would fain ascribe a divine infallibility of the hand, notwithstanding that they now and then make a mistake, as every mortal is liable to do. But they are skilled and inventive, and always ready in a moment to arrange into the structure of the score the most accidental tone (where the jerk of a finger or a humor brings it about), and to animate the accident with a fine meaning and soul.</p>

<p>I have a taste for writing. When a piece of writing is <em>good</em>, I can tell. When a piece of writing is crap, I can tell too. I can even tell how to turn crappy writing into something less crappy: remove or replace a word, rearrange that phrase, come up with a more fitting metaphor. If I have written something that is not good enough, it doesn‚Äôt sit well with me: I feel a mental itch to make it better.</p>

<p>Not everyone has a taste for writing. Some people cannot read at all. Others, when given an exquisite piece of text, exclaim, <em>‚ÄúWhat are they trying to say!?‚Äù</em> or <em>‚ÄúWhy not use simpler words?‚Äù</em> or <em>‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt they use bullet points?‚Äù</em> And then there are those well-meaning folks who say, in the spirit of all-encompassing acceptance,  <em>‚Äúwho decides what is good and what is bad? Anything goes! It‚Äôs all human expression!‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>One might also say ‚Äú<em>In my humble opinion, this book, which you consider the finest achievement in human literature, is not worth the paper it is written on!‚Äù</em> - one man‚Äôs meat is another man‚Äôs poison  (please set this ‚Äúobjectivity of aesthetics‚Äù discussion aside for a moment, will you?)</p>

<p>One can find principles of good writing. <em>‚ÄúDo not use filler words‚Äù</em>, <em>‚ÄúShow, Don‚Äôt Tell‚Äù</em>, <em>‚ÄúPrefer action verbs to nouns and adverbs‚Äù</em>. Many of them are taught in writing schools. And to some extent, being mindful of these can make your writing better. But great writing seems to be doing something different. It often deviates from these principles at just the right moments. It has a sense of naturalness and truth and aliveness and energy and electricity and flow and expansiveness. This is because great writers are not conscientiously following the principles of good writing, but following something else: their taste. Or feelings. Or inner experience.  And those things are prior to any principles.</p>

<hr />

<p>Some people have a refined taste for food. <em>‚ÄúCorrect me if I‚Äôm wrong, but do I detect a dash of coriander in this?‚Äù</em>, they say. Not only can they tell when something tastes good, but also how to make something taste better. <em>‚Äúthis needs more salt‚Äù</em>; <em>‚Äúthis could do with a squeeze of lemon‚Äù</em>. Every now and then they can even detect the signature of the chef in the cuisine, just like one can tell an artist from their art. <em>‚ÄúThe food tastes different now. Did they change the chef?‚Äù</em></p>

<p>If you do not have a taste for food, comments like that might leave you scratching your head. If that is you, you also probably tend to gobble down good food without relishing it, just like those who do not have a finer appreciation for literature will go through a well-written text without enjoying it. And you might not be able to tell if a dish can be improved by an addition of salt or seasoning just like those without a taste for literature are not able to tell how to make it better with a change of word or rearrangement of a phrase.</p>

<p>Just like there are principles that can make a piece of writing good: there are principles that can make something taste good. Salt enhances flavour, acid balances it, and fat carries it. A delicious meal is something that indulges more than one of our taste centres: the more the better. Salted Caramel tastes better than either salt or caramel: putting the salty and the sweet together produces something much better than the sum of its parts. So it is with lemonade (sour, sweet, salty). Or coffee and chocolate (bittersweet). A second one: a contrast in texture works well. A runny egg and a crisp toasty bread make each other better, a perfect grilled cheese sandwich has a crusty exterior and a soft interior, so does a Victoria sponge cake.</p>

<p>As in writing, the taste is prior to principles: the principles are common patterns found in what tastes good, they are post-hoc abstractions. A person with good taste is not someone who is mechanically following the principles of good taste - it is not the case that the person tastes something and goes ‚Äúthis does not adhere to the principles, so it tastes bad!‚Äù. Rather, they are actually <em>tasting</em>, they are experiencing, and it is their senses that feed them back the feeling of <em>‚Äúyummy‚Ä¶soooo good‚Äù</em> or <em>‚Äúew, something is off with this!‚Äù</em></p>

<hr />

<p>I used to imagine myself as one who does not possess a proper sense of taste. I would tell myself I don‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù food, that I am not a foodie, that food is merely fuel for my body and I am happy to eat anything. Basically, a thought of the form ‚Äúthis  spoonful of sauce that just touched base with my tongue could do with more salt‚Äù would never occur to me.</p>

<p>For the most part, life flew merrily by: my interest and attention lay in other aspects of human experience. I was low-maintenance, an easygoing customer in restaurants who would never complain about the food, and at dinner parties, I made for a happy-go-lucky guest, grateful for anything served, at times indifferent to any culinary suffering that other guests might have had to endure, at other times unable to offer a discerning appreciation for the delicious delights the hosts might have taken great pains to prepare.</p>

<hr />

<p>Cooking without tasting is like sketching blindfolded. While tasting well does not require one to know how to cook (it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you know ‚Äòhow the sausage is made‚Äô), and while one can produce a good meal by merely following a recipe, the true art and genius of cooking lies in improvisation, in adjusting balance on-the-go, in paying attention to the actual experience of tasting something and using it to ask ‚ÄúWhat could I do to make this taste better?‚Äù. Cooking well requires tasting well.</p>

<p>Some people seem to have a ‚Äúnatural hand‚Äù for cooking. I suspect those who are not natural at cooking must be doing something similar to what I used to do when I started to cook: I would treat the recipe like a fixed algorithm, to be followed to the dot. I would pay no attention to food as it was cooking (as a result, I would often end up undercooking the tomato. Or steaming the chicken surface, instead of browning it). I would eat cooked food quickly rather than taste mindfully. And I paid no heed to seasonings like salt, lemon, and fat, thinking them unimportant. In short, I would cook a meal like a computer might produce mathematical proof or an AI might write a poem: without <em>‚Äúgetting it</em>‚Äù<sup id="fnref:AI" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:AI" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ultuqYot5yE">Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is low maintenance and too cool to care</a></p>

<p>But if you‚Äôd asked me then, I wouldn‚Äôt have known that I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúget it‚Äù; I didn‚Äôt even know there was something to ‚Äúget‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt care about my experience of taste, so whatever I cooked worked for me. I would wolf it down. If I did notice something off with it, I would double down on the precision of the proportions and the timings outlined in the recipe next time. The result might have been better. It might have even been outstanding, just like a poem generated by AI might have technical merits. But I still wouldn‚Äôt have <em>‚Äúgot it‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>If I did ‚Äúget it‚Äù, I would have found that it is not necessary to follow a recipe to exactitude. The same ingredients can vary in taste - even tomatoes growing in different sides of the same tree can differ. A recipe might ask for two tablespoons of olive oil for two onions, but if the pan has a large surface area, that probably won‚Äôt be enough to coat it - one of the ways  recipe writers determine the quantity of oil to be used. So one has to pay attention to food as it cooks, and look for the right signs. Is the bottom of the pan coated with fat when sautering? Is the oil hot enough for the chicken to brown? Is the surface of the chicken dry? Does the oil come halfway up the sides of the food when shallow-frying? Do onions look like how they should look when sweated, browned, or caramelised? (one has to know how onions look at different stages of cooking). Does the sauce taste bland or bitter, does it need more salt? Is it overly sweet or sour?</p>

<p>Good cooks look at the food as it cooks. They smell it. They taste it. And then adjust on-the-go.  For that one has to know the actual tasting experience they are trying to ‚Äúget at‚Äù. That requires a sensitivity to what is good taste, and what is bad taste.  Good cooking is not just about memorizing a recipe and following it to the tee: instead, it is about seeing, smelling, tasting. It is about the senses.</p>

<hr />

<p>For a while, I thought <em>getting it</em> meant <em>understanding it</em>.</p>

<p>I held the idea that cooking didn‚Äôt sustain my attention because I did not understand the ‚Äúwhys‚Äù of cooking: Why do I preheat the pan before adding the oil? Why not let both heat up together? Why put ingredients in oil when it is sizzling hot? Why not do it at the start, so one can save up on the heat? Why pat dry the chicken before cooking? Why leave it to rest after cooking? Why does this thing goes after that thing, and not before? Does marination affect meat? <em>Does it now, really?</em></p>

<p>To understand the magic, I read Samir Nosrat‚Äôs excellent book: <em>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</em>, turned my kitchen into a laboratory, and simultaneously embarked on some cooking experiments to test the principles therein.<sup id="fnref:experiment" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:experiment" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I found some answers in chemistry, some in practical logic. It is recommended to ‚Äúpat dry‚Äù the chicken before browning it because the water on the surface might otherwise lead to steaming the chicken. That will cook the chicken, but it won‚Äôt brown it. The browning is a result of the Maillard Reaction that only happens above the boiling point of water. Water escapes as steam when temperatures rise, so we need another medium: oil. If put the chicken before we heat is oil, it might start cooking before the desired temperature for Maillard Reaction has been achieved, and might lead to chicken that is overcooked. We also cook both sides of the surface of the chicken first, to ‚Äúseal in the moisture‚Äù, so that the inside stays juicy and tender. If the inside is cooked before the outside has been sealed, it might lose moisture and become dry and rubbery. And allowing the chicken to rest after cooking allows the protein to settle, which allows it to retain moisture for longer, leading to a juicier texture.</p>

<p>Recipes also follow an inner logic depending on their ingredients. The sequence is constrained by how long each ingredient takes to cook and how they affect each other. In Indian cooking, whole spices take longer to cook and so they are the first thing that go in. They‚Äôre cooked in fat or oil because spices require a temperature much above boiling point of water to cook properly, and oil achieves that without being vaporised. (Also unlike water, fat also coats the tongue and allows aromatic flavours to remain in contact with our taste buds for longer). Onions take a while to cook, too, so added early with the spices. Garlic, if overcooked, turns bitter so it only cooked for a couple of mins. Tomatoes are added only after onions are cooked because the acid in tomatoes can prevent the softening of onions. The acid in tomatoes can also prevent the salt from dissolving and distributing evenly in the dish if added too early, so salt is added only after the tomato is partially cooked. Dairy should be added to acidic dishes at the last minute because otherwise, it will curdle.</p>

<p>For me, the new-found understanding infused the activity of cooking with a fine layer of meaning. Once I realised the rationale and relevance of each instruction, I was more likely to pay it its due respect.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbk9MhZyWKY">Ewan McGregor in Perfect Sense strikes a fine balance</a></p>

<p>But did it help me see, smell, taste? Did it make me more likely to taste a sample of my stew, and say to myself ‚Äúit needs more salt!‚Äù?</p>

<p><em>Understanding it</em> is not the same as <em>getting it</em>. I had sought out the whys of cooking to satisfy a niggling sense of ‚Äúlack‚Äù in my refined perception of taste. But without paying attention to my own experience, I was looking in the realm of reason for something that belonged only in the realm of sense, feeling and experience. It was a wrong turn, a red herring, a dead end, a blind alley.</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<p>A combination of intense introspection, knowledge from the cookbook, and my blind tasting experiments led me to the truth that was staring me in the face all this time - a truth obvious to anyone who cares about their eating experience. The ultimate answer to the ‚Äúwhys‚Äù of a recipe, something that lies at the foundation to the inquiries of chemistry - the Maillard Reaction and caramelization and coagulation of proteins in marination and the breakdown of plant cell walls under heat, and the evolution of cooking practices, lies in the actual experience of taste.<sup id="fnref:safety" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:safety" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>A chicken browned has complex flavours in its crispy exterior and is moist and tender in its interior. When this piece of tender, juicy, crispy chicken makes contact with your tongue, as you wrap your mouth around it and sink your teeth into it, the skin shatters and you experience an explosion of delight. Few moments in a meal can rival a bite of expertly-cooked chicken. It has creds to be among the finest pleasures known to man, right next to listening to a Bach symphony, witnessing the light ethereal beauty of Taj Mahal, and making connected love to a person you find beautiful.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poe71BtB9Mk&amp;list=PLdIS7dENF-nXuG_spHpqy05J0qat1sp6t&amp;index=55">Tilda Swinton in ‚ÄúI Am Love‚Äù experiencing a fine moment of culinary pleasure</a></p>

<p>This experience of eating something delicious is an end in itself. Its a pure desire. One desires it not for someone else, not because others also seem to like it, not for some moral good, not because it is supposed to do so, not for society‚Äôs conventions or what society values, not for some status, not because it would make you thinner, beautiful, healthier, stronger,  but because it is fundamentally pleasurable to your sense of taste.</p>

<p>Crucially - you, and other peope wanting the same delicious experience, is the primary motivating force for cooking in the way we do, for the entire cooking industry, for Michelin star resaurants and cookery shows and cooking reality tv shows. If one centres themseleves on this experience, all the steps one needs to do to get there follow automatically; the wisdom and knowledge contained in the recipe is a mere by-product. People who are sensitive to taste have this experience of the sensations in the tongue centred in their lives, this is something that draws their attention naturally, this is what drives them.</p>

<p>To cultivate the skill of improvisation in cooking, to adjust-on-the-go, to understand balance, to be able to make a dish taste better, to invent new dishes from the leftovers in your referigerator, one need only pay attention to their sense of taste. And it is possible to answer to why this, or why that,  with the foundational reason: ‚Äúit tastes better that way than otherwise‚Äù. Those who have paid attention to this sense, cultivated it,  and gained wisdom from it, are the ones who ‚Äúget it‚Äù. And that‚Äôs all there is to it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Once I started attending to my experience of taste and brought it into awareness, it was as if I flipped a switch. A lightbulb went off, and a new reality of lived everyday experience revealed itself to me.</p>

<p>What I had thought of myself previously - that I did not care about taste -  wasn‚Äôt completely true to how I operated. If I had paid any attention to what I actually did (rather than what I told myself),<sup id="fnref:else" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:else" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> I would have observed that I don‚Äôt just eat everything willy-nilly. Instead, I would leave out any discernible pieces of tomatoes when presented a salad: as if on auto-pilot. On a supermarket aisle, I would rarely buy carrots or potatoes. When choosing items from a menu, I would gravitate towards certain items and away from others. There were certain eateries I would want to visit again and again, almost instinctually. And I had lots of memories of food that, at the time I tasted it, had made my eyes lit up and made me go ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like some more of that, please!‚Äù.<sup id="fnref:list" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:list" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>So, my body did have a sense of taste and it did reveal preferences for food in behavior. I wasn‚Äôt just aware of those preferences. It wasn‚Äôt so much that I did not have a taste perception earlier. It wasn‚Äôt like I was blind and now I could see. Instead, I had vision, but thinking myself blind, I had stopped looking. Once I became aware of my vision, I started looking, and found that I could see clearer and further.</p>

<p>How people respond to food in common culture started making sense, and it became increasingly difficult for me to continue to gobble down bland unseasoned food when a little addition of salt or a squeeze of lemon could make my experience much better at no extra cost.</p>

<p>I finally got ‚Äúit‚Äù (and my feedback became more authentic at dinner parties )</p>

<hr />

<p>You might find all this amusing and obvious.  You might be thinking: Good for him! The guy can taste better and cook well now - I never had any issues with that.</p>

<p>Or something like: ‚ÄúGuy zeroes in on something that is natural and obvious to everyone, makes a big deal out of it, and converts it into a whole intellectual thing‚Äù.</p>

<p>Or: ‚ÄúOMG! Just eat, man! No one goes into asking whys and reading books and doing blind experiments. That‚Äôs not what enjoying food is about!‚Äù</p>

<p>And you‚Äôd be totally right, of course.  That brings me to my next point.</p>

<p>If one were to look to improve their writing in the absence of a sense of language, they would look for some rules of good writing and mechanically follow them. If one were to improve their sense of taste in the absence of paying attention to their taste, they would eat food robotically, as fuel. If one were to improve their cooking in the absence of sight, smell or taste, they would robotically follow the recipes. In the absence of an experience, this is the best they can do. In all of these scenarios, the person does not get ‚Äúit‚Äù, they might not know that they do not ‚Äúget it‚Äù - they might not be even aware that there is something to ‚Äúget‚Äù;  yet, from the outset, it might not look too different from those who ‚Äúget it‚Äù.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is not limited to eating and tasting, but extends far into every aspect of human life; it manifests in every behavior one can think of. Its there when it comes to beauty, love, desire, justice, equality, inner experience of neurodivergence, and spirituality. The same pitfalls or potential wrong turns are present on those - all the ways of ‚Äúnot getting it‚Äù.  But the same strides in attending to experience, deepening of awareness, and expanding the possibilities of the self can be made with a little tuning in, and picking up the right track.</p>

<p>In subsequent posts, I would pick up different aspects of human experience - music and listening, drawing and seeing,  mathematical inutition, moral sense, energy and feelings, connection and love, desire and eros, justice and equality, dance and movement, religion, science and spirituality. In each one of them, I would explore my own journey and some views of other philosophers.</p>

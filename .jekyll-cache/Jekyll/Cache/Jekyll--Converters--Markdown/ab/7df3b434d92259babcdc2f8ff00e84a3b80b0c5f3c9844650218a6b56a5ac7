I"¶<p>They love meâ€¦they love me not.</p>

<p>I feel by now I have a pretty good handle on the question. I donâ€™t have to pick the petals of a poor flower: my body could tell.</p>

<p>â€œ<em>You sort of knowâ€¦donâ€™t youâ€</em> said my friend Dawne. That you just <em>know</em> whether youâ€™d hit it off with someone - pre-communication, pre-familiarity, pre- any dating rituals - was an idea that wafted through my skeptical mind - completely bypassed it - and struck a chord in the same area where the knowingness resided. It was true and I just knew it.</p>

<p>This is my attempt to reflect on the times Iâ€™ve felt loved,  felt the absence of it, and everything in between.</p>

<p>I am currenty working as a software engineer in Cambridge (UK).</p>

<!-- I enjoy learning, teaching, and creative collaborations. I am particularly interested in alternative economic and social arrangements to academia that encourage the pursuit of research, higher learning and teaching.

My long-term project, [Platonia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.platonialabs.platonia), can now be downloaded on Google playstore. One of the best way to learn is to teach it to someone. Platonia allows you to organize one-on-one meetups with people near you for learning-and-teaching. -->

<p>I read for a second BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford.  I was supported by the KC Mahindra Scholarship, <a href="https://www.tiarafoundation.com/copy-of-tiara-special-grant">Tiara Special Grant</a>, and a second undergraduate degree scholarship by Harris Manchester College.</p>

<p>Previously, I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Delhi">IIT Delhi</a> with a five-year Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Computing in 2013. My masterâ€™s thesis was in the design of approximation algorithms for networks under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen_Garg">Naveen Garg</a>. Hereâ€™s a <a href="../files/research/thesis.pdf">link to my thesis</a>.  <!-- The [research section](/research)  gives a summary of my research projects. --></p>

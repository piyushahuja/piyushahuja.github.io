I" <p>The most depressing thing about studying philosophy is finding out, or realising, that all your breakthrough insights, all those ideas which you thought were great and original, have already been discovered and explored to their very depths, dissected, torn apart, rebutted, unravelled and debunked, and their rebuttals and criticisms argued against, and the counters to criticisms counter-critiqued, and so on, over the course of history by people who lived long before you were even born. There is no role left for you to play, nothing left for you to add, nothing left for you to do, but to wink foolishly and gape at your own shallowness.</p>

<p>The second most depressing thing about studying philosophy is to suddenly realise, to your utter horror, that your world is actually overrun by idiots, that all your life youâ€™ve been surrounded by them - theyâ€™re everywhere!, that people who youâ€™ve been sharing this world with donâ€™t have an iota of clue of what they are talking about, the philosophical positions they are unwittingly committing to, and the invisible assumptions theyâ€™ve unknowingly become slaves to, and whatâ€™s worse - that youâ€™re one of them!</p>

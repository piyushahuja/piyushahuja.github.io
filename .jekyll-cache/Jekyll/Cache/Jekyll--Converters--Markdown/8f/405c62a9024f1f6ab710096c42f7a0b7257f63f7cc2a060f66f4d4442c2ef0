<p>Komic, at 4513m, is one of the highest villages in the world. It has no police, no post office, no hospital - none of the things any typical village might take for granted - but it does have a monastery, which is, quite expectedly, one of the highest in the world. Being â€˜one of the highestâ€™ isnâ€™t just a superlative meant to promote tourism, but comes with its own associated baggage.  some of the realities of life at high altitudes, especially  the accompanying geographical and altitudinal inconveniences. During the winter months, for example, the temperate hits as low as -40 degree Celsius. The village families are forced indoors during the entire season, and snow has to be melted with the help of firewood to meet any water requirements. Firewood isnâ€™t easily available - there are practically no trees in this desert - so the villagers collect the wood over the entire year for the winter season - much like the ants in the â€˜The Ant and the Grasshopperâ€™ fable. Burning the wood itself causes the emission of carbon dioxide and black carbon, which particulates settle on the nearby glaciers causing them to melt. Economically expensive, environmentally damaging and logistically harsh -  life at high altitudes is no <em>__</em>.

<p>Our group came here with a mission - to construct a solar bath for the monks in the monastery. Back when I signed up for it, it sounded just like the kind of thing I needed. Just last year I had backpacked across Rajasthan, Gujarat and Kerala. In that trip, even though I had many interesting encounters, and loads of unique experiences, and so on, in the end it all felt frivolous - like my journey had had no real effect on the world. Sure it did contribute to my personal growth, but it  still felt like a selfish indulgence. The Spiti arrangement, on the other hand, involved adventurous travel with purpose and meaning. Trekking up to remote villages in the trans-Himalayas to help in the the lives of the mountain folks - Now who wouldnâ€™t want to do that?</p>

<p>Such soul-engulfing beauty. Words beat me. I wonder if the villages understand the sheer heavenliness of it all. I get it now why it was the Buddhists that came up with concepts like Nirvana.</p>

<p>But I am getting ahead of myself. It is impossible not to. Words are like 2 dimensional, while I am floating in the infinities of an infinite dimensional space. Everything is like nothing. Itâ€™s a cliche, but one perfectly apt here. All the earthly human emotions - attraction, jealousy, ambition, attachments and desire - all the human worries have been washed away in this tide of transcendental peaceful soulful currents.</p>

<p>I am sitting, Buddha-like, on the edge of a hill. Behind me is the monastery for which we are to build a solar bath over the next few days - Iâ€™m responsible for laying the groundwork tomorrow, while the other groups will be involved with mud work, masonry and cooking. The vast expanse in front of me has had held me in a trance for quite some while. Thereâ€™s the farmland, being tilled by the village ladies, thereâ€™s the grazing cattle - cows and sheep- overlooked by a shepherd and a cowherd. The landscape just ahead of the grid like farmlands is spattered by houses - the home stays, including the big one, where we are staying.</p>

<p>Stuff like this rekindles the imagination, the childhood visions that get buried under lifeâ€™s crap as we grow old.</p>

I"[<p>There is a “way of be” in the world that is tantric.</p>

<p>It is non-reactive and relaxed.
It feels effortless, free, in the “flow of life”, genuine, authentic, “in integrity”.
All emotions are welcome, including: fear, anger, sadness (to investigate: what about “stress”, “anxiety”, “nervousness”, “jealousy”). 
It has heightened awareness of your own emotions, your senses. 
You see reality “as is”, including the emotions of others. 
You have needs, but you are not “needy”. You are not in a “getting” state. 
You give freeily, but do not “give to get”.
You are able to play and take risks.</p>

<p>Often I criticize myself for not being socially savvy, for not being able to make small talk or have conversations with beautiful women. But the reason I feel uncomfortable to talk to certain woman have nothing to do with ability, but often about the cues that I have subconsciously picked up on how the other person’s attitutde towards me.</p>

<p>Example: After the men-women reunion, I felt comfortable talking to Sarah, Kathy, Vanese, Stella, but not with Ingrid, Katie, etc. This was entirely due on them, and nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>It might be good to bring these cues to awareness, so that I communicate.</p>

<p>Erring on the side of asking for permission always works: “Would you be comfortable texting?” rather than assuming one way or the other. If i assume too much, I might signal i am not good at boundaries, or am intrusive. If I assume too less, I might miss out on connection where possibility of connection exists.</p>

<ul>
  <li>May I hold your hand?</li>
  <li>Would you be comfortable talking about sexual matters?</li>
  <li>Would you be open to texting?</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I have trauma informed patterns</strong></p>

<p>Truth is, I was in a very different state of mind (and feeling) when I started this journey than I am now. It is impossible to recall how I my internal experience of myself used to be, but I remember the facts clearly:</p>

<p>I broke down in tears after Vanese’s initiation in LT1. Slowly at first, then violently when I realized that my beloved wouldnt not only look at me, but wouldnt even care for me. It felt pretty natural then, and was cathartic, but it was, in hindsight, what they call a “trauma response.” It triggered all those memories of not being loved, not being cared for, and importantly, of “being abandoned”. I had thoughts of “This, Again, Ofcourse”, “Would anyone ever love me?”, “I have to live with this pattern forever”.</p>

<p>I also got incredibly melancholic after the Men-Women reunion after LT1 in Florence House, after observing my beloved. Slowly at first, then back at the mattress. Mellower than the first, but this was also a “trauma response” that reminded me of all previous instances of false hope.</p>

<p>At the end of LT1, I spoke to Sarah about “I am not someone on the margin”. It was comletely informed by how I imagined she saw me, rather than how I was feeling.</p>

<p>I “got back” at Rich after my initiation in LT2. At the time, I felt in my power and proud of myself. And though difficult to see, this was also “a trauma response”. Was it? Although the response was informed by fear of “being bullied”. it was authentic and in tune with how I was feeling. It was also controlled. What it did lack was a mindful awareness of my feeling. And it definitely lacked awareness of all the other ways I could have responded, or channeled my energy. It was reactive, it lacked mindful choice.</p>

<p>Would I have the same reaction if the same series of events were to happen to me now?</p>

<p>Possibly not. I have received loved by the one I so desired love from in my LT1, I was chosen by the one I desired in Florence House LT1, and I have received love from Jo. I am lovable, I can be loved, I have been loved, I am loved and I will be loved.</p>

<p>Do I still have trauma informed pattenrs?</p>

<p>One is the “fear of being taken for granted”</p>

<p><strong>Wheel of Consent</strong></p>

<p>An insight: an energetic transaction or exchange is not just about “give”
 and “take”, i.e. it is not single dimensional. One can “take” by giving, and “give” by taking”. It is two dimensional.</p>

<p>How does one give by taking? When one asks “What can I do for you?”</p>

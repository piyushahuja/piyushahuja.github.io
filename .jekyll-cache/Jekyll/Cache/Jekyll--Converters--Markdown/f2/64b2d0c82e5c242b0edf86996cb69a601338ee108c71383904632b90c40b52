  <p>One measure of how good the writing is is how little effort it requires for the reader to track whatâ€™s going on. For example, I am not an absolute believer in standard punctuation at all times, but one thing thatâ€™s often a big shock to my students is that punctuation isnâ€™t merely a matter of pacing or how you would read something out loud. These marks are, in fact, cues to the reader for how very quickly to organize the various phrases and clauses of the sentence so the sentence as a whole makes sense.</p>

  <a class="title" href="/courses/writing/sentence">Sentence</a>
  </p>
  <!--<p class="excerpt"><p>Thereâ€™s no evidence that certain words are objectively beautiful or beloved by the majority of people. Many individuals have words that they love, but your favorites and mine are probably different. Iâ€™m a fan of click, lizard, oh, alabaster, loon, crinkle, zigzag, fay, vim, fuck, luscious, scissors, cunt, and quagmire.Â  But, for me, beauty in language is less about individual works and more about words in contexts. Depending on the sentence or phrase itâ€™s housed in, almost any word can be beautiful or ugly.Â  The word â€œseeâ€ isnâ€™t special to me on its own, but it becomes magical when Shakespeare has Ophelia say, â€œO, woe is me / To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!â€ and the words â€œitâ€ and â€œthing,â€ which are normally humdrum, shine in the slogans â€œCoke is it!â€ and â€œItâ€™s the real thing.â€</p>

My technique is to write an email. Not one Iâ€™ll ever send, but one Iâ€™ll actually write in gmail, rather than in a word processor, even if itâ€™s an essay or short story. (Gmail is great for this, because it saves drafts, so you can start and stop.) I pick an appropriate person to write to, usually a non-expert, and explain my idea, make my appeal, defend my claim, tell my funny story â€¦</p>

And so, suddenly, I hear something and often I canâ€™t even remember doing it. Or I have a very vague memory of it, because a lot of these pieces, theyâ€™re just something I started at half past eight one evening and then finished at quarter past ten, gave some kind of funny name to that doesnâ€™t describe anything, and then completely forgot about, and then, years later, on the random shuffle, this thing comes up, and I think, Wow, I didnâ€™t hear it when I was doing it. And I think that often happensâ€”we donâ€™t actually hear what weâ€™re doing.Â .Â .Â . I often find pieces and I think, This is genius. Which me did that? Who was the me that did that?</p>

<p><strong>Assignments</strong></p>

<p>Every assignment would be delivered in five versions: A three page version, a one page version, a three paragraph version, a one paragraph version, and a one sentence version.</p>

<p>Along the way youâ€™d trade detail for brevity. Hopefully adding clarity at each point.  Each step requires asking â€œWhatâ€™s really important?â€ Thatâ€™s the most important question you can ask yourself about anything. The class would really be about answering that very question at each step of the way. Whittling it all down until all thatâ€™s left is the point.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<p>Draft a piece in your usual way. Save a copy.
Delete 1/10 of the paragraphs. This may remove important ideas. Thatâ€™s okay. Weâ€™ll restore those (or try to) in step 6. When calculating 1/10, round up. That is, if you start with fifteen paragraphs, delete two and not one.
Delete 1/10 of the remaining sentences.
Delete 1/10 of the remaining words.
Note the number of words in the thrice decimated piece. This is your word count limit.
Revise to restore any essential ideas that were lost in steps 2â€“4, but do not exceed the word count limit from step 5.
My writerâ€™s group did this exercise. It was excruciating. But it was worth the pain. Everyoneâ€™s writing came to life.</p>

<p>Some things youâ€™ll learn:</p>

<p>Your patterns and habits that add unnecessary words. Maybe youâ€™ll learn that you overuse â€œto beâ€ verbs, or insert too many weasel words, such as â€œperhapsâ€ or â€œsomehowâ€.
How to find strong verbs and nouns that do all the work of multiple weaker words.
How to identify and emphasize the essence of what you are trying to say, and prioritize what to include and what to exclude.</p>

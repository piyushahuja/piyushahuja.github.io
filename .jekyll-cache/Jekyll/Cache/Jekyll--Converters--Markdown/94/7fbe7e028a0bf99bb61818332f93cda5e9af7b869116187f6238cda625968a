I"n<p>Rafael Nadal announced his retirement this month, and I want to take this moment to reflect on what made him special.</p>

<hr />

<p>Some people light up your eyes by their very presence. They expand your idea of what it is possible to be. When he first appeared on the circuit, there wasn’t anyone remotely like him.  <a href="https://x.com/troublefault/status/1847695446434525482">“How beautifully bonkers it was when this loco kid in pirate pants showed up &amp; started bludgeoning everyone off the court”</a>, as one Twitter user put it.</p>

<p>During that tennis era, as he surpassed his contemporaries: Hewitt, Roddick, Safin, Nalbandian - Federer felt invincible, and acted like he was. In his interviews and his demeanour, Federer came off as if he believed that he was destined for greatness,  him winning was a foregone conclusion, and him losing was an affront against the laws of nature. Chief amongst his virtues were his “graceful” movement and his tennis “effortlesss.” David Foster Wallace wrote an essay on him. Gradually, he embraced the persona of tennis royalty.</p>

<p>Nadal’s tennis, on the other hand, was as effortful as ones can be. He would chase down to retreieve balls that most players would give up on. He always acted like an underdog. His movement was described by Federer as a “tiger in a cage always going around, stuff to do, always preparing”, “always warming up”</p>

<p>Instead of effortlessness, Nadal’s “incredible intensity”. Instead of grace and class, he radiated boyish charm and rebellion. His style was not RF emblamzoned in white blazer, but sleeverless shirts and pirate pants.</p>

<p>His English was sloppy,</p>

<p>Nadal taught Federer humility.</p>

<p>Even after having upstaged him, Nadal was very happy to concede the title of the best player to Federer.
<a href="https://x.com/gigicat7_/status/1846664665683972119">“I am not sad to lose to the best player in the world”</a></p>

<p>Djokovic never gave Federer the respect he deserved.</p>

<p>Federer was</p>

<p>Nadal’s motivation was sheer focus.</p>

<p>Djokovic wanted to be the top. His motivation was status.</p>

The problem with being Elon Musk is that he has no more green grass to chase, so imagines that grass on Mars.

The good thing about chasing the grass is greener on the other side is that it makes you chase, travel on roads to cities with skyscrapers, rather than be self satisfied in your little village tending to cows.

The wisdom is that not that the grass is not greener on the other side, that is is just as green on your side, but that grass can be grown where is ground for it to grow and willingness on your part, and that is more fulfilling than any grass consuming you can do, and the task of man. 

The real treasure is the friends

You were supposed to water the grass on your side, instead of chasing the greener one.

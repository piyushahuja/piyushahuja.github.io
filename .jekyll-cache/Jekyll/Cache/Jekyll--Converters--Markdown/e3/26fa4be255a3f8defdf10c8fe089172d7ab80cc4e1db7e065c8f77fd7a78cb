<h1 id="what-is-docker">What is Docker?</h1>

<p>Docker is a form of OS-level virtualisation whose purpose is, to quote:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Package up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="why-docker">Why Docker?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Speed</strong>: isolated, consistent and repeatable environments
for your developers to fire up a new version of the application that a collogue may have written requires muddling around in Git and using branches – this interrupts work flows and can lead to lose of work if “git stash” isn’t used right. With a container: they just run it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Portability</strong>: Docker images define abstract and immutable run time environment independent of the underlying hardware platform and packages it into a well defined and efficient image specification. With Dockerhub, we have a global distribution network
First up: portability and allowing anyone, on any hardware, and any OS to run the application with a single command. All they need to do is install Docker and “docker run” will do the rest. With a TAR file based deployment, they need TAR, they need to know how-to deploy the application and manage the files; they may need some runtime on their system like Ruby, Python or NodeJS; and they cannot restrict the resources the application is using…</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Simplifies your infrastructure requirements</strong>
you can restrict the resources the application is using inside of a container much easier than you can with one that is not.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Automation</strong> is first class citizen: Dockerfile, DockerCompose
one final point here: Docker Compose. You’re missing out on a lot of free stuff here. It’s so easy to write a Docker Compose file that brings up everything needed by the application - databases, caches, mocked APIs - allowing anyone in your organisation to bring up the application on their laptop and play with it, including the CEO, DBAs, QA, the receptionist. </li>
</ul>

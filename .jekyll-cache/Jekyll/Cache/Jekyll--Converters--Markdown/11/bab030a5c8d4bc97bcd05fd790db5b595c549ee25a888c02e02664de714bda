<p>AIMO Prize: The AIMO Prize is a $10mn challenge fund, founded and supported by XTX Markets, designed to spur the open development of AI models that can reason mathematically, leading to the creation of a publicly shared AI model capable of winning a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).</p>

<p>The first progress prize included problems at intermediate-level high school mathematics competitions. A unique dataset of 800k+ competitive level problems and solutions was a key success factor for winning and we are thrilled to release it to the public. We now look forward to seeing far better models built upon the Numina dataset.</p>

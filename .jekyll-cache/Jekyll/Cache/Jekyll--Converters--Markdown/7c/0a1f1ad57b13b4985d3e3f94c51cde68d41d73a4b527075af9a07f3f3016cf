I"ü<p>Human beings have various ideals that they value, that constitute what would be for them a good life, whose fulfilment they work towards. The idea of the good for each individual is informed by their circumstances, their unique talents and capacities,  their nature and their nurture. Very often ideas of the good are mutually incompatible. A vegetarian might regard consumption of meat as immoral and vile, a bodybuilder pursuing athletic excellence might value it instrumentally as a source of protein, while someone with a hedonistic bent may feel that such simple pleasures make life worth living in the first place. The appeal of liberalism, under such pluralism, lies in its apparent fairness to all ways of life.  I say apparent because a liberal society does seem to encourage certain values over others: the virtues of tolerance, the ideals of democracy, the spirit of secularism, individualism over collectivism, international cooperation, and so forth. This leads one to ask: Might liberalism be just another doctrine of the good life, masquerading as a neutral framework?  This is an important question, for if liberalism is merely one idea of the good life in competition with other such ideas, then it would lose much of its appeal and privileged status.</p>

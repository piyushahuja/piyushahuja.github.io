I":<p>I turned 30 this year. By now I know this: I will probably never be rich, famous, attractive or powerful. I will never reach the pinnacle of sports, entertainment, academia, politics, or business. No Olympic Medal, no Oscar, no Nobel Prize, no Prime Ministership, no billion-dollar wealth is coming my way.</p>

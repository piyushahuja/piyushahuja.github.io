  <p>There are not hundreds of millions of people in the world who walk outside every day wanting to meet somebody new that day. The excitement is around connecting people in a shared location such that IF they were to decide to meet in real life, they would be able to. This may not happen right after they connect online, but the possibility that they could is compelling for every person in the world. Human beings have an evolutionary urge to connect with other humans, in person, going back to clansmen survival instincts in the beginning of mankind. <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-close-is-anybody-to-solving-the-social-networking-problem-of-connecting-new-people">Evan Reas of Circle</a></p>

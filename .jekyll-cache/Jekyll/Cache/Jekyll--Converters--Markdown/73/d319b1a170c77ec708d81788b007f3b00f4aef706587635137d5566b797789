I"!<p>Pattern:</p>

<p>I want to connect with everyone. I want them to like me. If someone doesn’t like me, I want to do things to make them like me.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A connection is not your sole responsbility: it is carried by two. There is a division of responsibility. By fixing a connection, doing all the work, you’re taking on their responsibility for them.</li>
  <li>To do things to get someone to like you is manipulative: it has an agenda “to get”.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Antidote: Listen to body</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learnt to listen to the body. The body is taking all kinds of signals from the environment, and it stores that knowledge. The body “knows” who accepts you and who doesn’t, regardless of how one presents themselves to you. Some of the women I felt anxious had said nothing to me, but the body “knew” that for one reason or the other, it didnt feel safe in their presence, and that caused anxiety. And often, the reason had some meat: they held a judgement about me, for example.</li>
  <li>Do NOT take on responsibility for what is NOT your responsibility.  Taking responsibility for things that are not yours to own is a form of appeasement, which can happen when a Man is intimidated by a Woman and wants to make her anger or disappointment go away. Do not allow yourself to be blamed for agreements that were never made and expectations that were not communicated to you clearly. Let her know that you love and cherish her, but that kind of stuff is not going to fly with you.</li>
</ul>

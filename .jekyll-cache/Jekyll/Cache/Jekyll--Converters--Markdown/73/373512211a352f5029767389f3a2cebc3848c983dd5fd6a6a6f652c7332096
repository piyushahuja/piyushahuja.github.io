<p>Hereâ€™s H.G. Wells describing time travel, which, in pure plot terms, could have been condensed to â€œhe went into the future.â€</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchbackâ€”of a helpless headlong motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous color like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue.</p>

<p>And while thereâ€™s excellent prose in non-fiction, itâ€™s easier to find great language in fiction. Here is a passage from E. B. Whiteâ€™s Charlotteâ€™s Web:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life in the barn was very goodâ€”night and day, winter and summer, spring and fall, dull days and bright days. It was the best place to be, thought Wilbur, this warm delicious cellar, with the garrulous geese, the changing seasons, the heat of the sun, the passage of swallows, the nearness of rats, the sameness of sheep, the love of spiders, the smell of manure, and the glory of everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rhythm is seductive, and Iâ€™m floored by â€œthe sameness of sheep.â€ What an intoxicating phrase.</p>

<hr />

<p>Novels also can evoke scenes, moods â€¦ entire world. Hereâ€™s F. Scott. Fitzgeraldâ€™s famous passage about a downtrodden village:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashesâ€“a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight.</p>

<hr />
<p>What are some elegant ways to describe or show human movement?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While writing I struggle to describe or show athletes or musicians without resorting to cliches or generalizations. Iâ€™m looking for good ways to describe the physical movement of say, a batter swinging a bat or a drummer playing a good beat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He savaged the drums.</p>

<p>He struck the ball with the force of a red-hot hammer striking an anvil.</p>

<p>His hands flew from the base drum, to the snare drum, to the cymbals. It was impossibly fast, as if he was running from New York to San Francisco and back in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>I know he hit the ball, because I saw it approach him, I saw him tense, and, a moment later, I saw the ball rocketing away from him. He must have made his move between units of time.</p>

<hr />

<p>What do â€œgoodâ€ metaphors or similes capture? In writing, the use of figurative language can elevate a so-so piece to writing to something memorable. What are the differences between good and bad metaphors and similes?
This question previously had details. They are now in a comment.

Originally Answered: What makes certain metaphors so good?
As a writer, your number-one job is to transfer something from your bain to the readerâ€™s brain. (Your number two job is to help the reader build new thoughts on top of whatever you transferred into his brain.) The item you transfer might be an idea, an image or a feeling. If itâ€™s an idea, you want the reader to understand it clearly; if itâ€™s an image, you want him to see it. (Or hear it, smell it, etc.) If itâ€™s a feeling, you want him to feel it.</p>

<p>With every word and sentence, you should ask yourself, â€œAm I employing the best tools at my disposal to transfer this idea, image or feeling into the readerâ€™s brain?â€ Am I flying from New York to London in a plane, or am stupidly trying to cross the Atlantic on a unicycle?</p>

<p>Sometimes the most effective data-transfer mechanism is literal description: â€œan insect crawled out of her eye socketâ€ probably wonâ€™t be served by figurative language. Itâ€™s plenty vivid as is.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m almost finished reading â€œ1Q84,â€ by Haruki Murakami, who is a master of simple, effective metaphor. He not only knows how to coin them; he is a master of when to use them. Alas, I donâ€™t have the novel in front of me, so Iâ€™m going to have to paraphrase, but he wrote something like, â€œShe hung up on him abruptly, as if someone had chopped through the phone cord with an axe.â€</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s brilliant about that is that it really adds something. â€œShe hung up abruptlyâ€ doesnâ€™t convey, by itself, the shock Murakamiâ€™s protagonist felt.</p>

<p>At least for me, the metaphor was an extremely effective feeling-transfer mechanism. I saw the axe fall, and I heard the chop. And I recalled times when Iâ€™d felt like being hung up on was an act of violence.</p>

<p>Marakami could have used description to explain how his hero felt, but that wouldnâ€™t have packed the same visceral punch. With description, I would have understand how the hero felt; the metaphor went one step further, making me feel what the hero felt.</p>

  <li>â€œ1Q84â€ was translated into English by Jay Rubin and Philip Gabriel.</li>

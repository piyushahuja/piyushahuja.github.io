<p>Linguistic analysis: truth value of stastements about existence depends on the
theory of truth: correspondence theory (truth relies on the correspondence between a statement an an external, independent reality), or internalist theory (context theory or intuitionist?)</p>

<p><strong>Is existence a property of individuals? If yes, are there individuals that lack it?</strong></p>

<p>Useful abstractions to dissect this question:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The relationship between an individual’s essence (being) and its existence</li>
</ul>

<p>A thing’s essential properties are inseparable from the bearer, not only in the sense that the property is necessarily had by that object (insofar as that object were to exist), but in the deeper sense that any adequate account of what that object is involves that property; they are part of any adequate definition of the thing or answer to the question ‘What is it?’. e.g. I am essentially a human and perhaps essentially the person I in fact am, if there are individual essences in addition to general essences.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The distinction between accident and essence and that distinction’s relation to contingency and necessity.</li>
</ul>

<p>All essences are necessary and all contingent properties are accidents (not necessary). But there is no strict one-to-one correspondence: there could be necessary properties which are not essential: I am necessarily identical to something and necessarily such that 2+2=4, but these properties are among my accidents, as they are not part of any adequate account of what I am and what distinguishes me from others.</p>

<p><strong>Position: No, existence is not a property.</strong></p>

<p>Argument 1 (Aristotle): Nothing more to existence than essence: “there is not a space between an articulation of what a thing is and that thing’s existing”</p>

<p>Argument 2 (Hume) There is no impression of existence distinct from the impression of an object, which is ultimately on Hume’s view a bundle of qualities. As all of our contentful ideas derive from impressions</p>

<p>Argument 3 (Kant) Proponents of the ontological argument argue that the concept of God as an entity with all perfections or a being of which no greater can be conceived entails God’s existence, as existence is a perfection and a being that exists is greater than a being that does not exist. Kant objected that existence is not a property: “Thus when I think a thing, through whichever and however many predicates I like (even in its thoroughgoing determination), not the least bit gets added to the thing when I posit in addition that this thing is. For otherwise what would exist would not be the same as what I had thought in my concept, but more than that, and I could not say that the very object of my concept exists”</p>

<p>Argument 4 (Frege, Russell):  existence is not a property of individuals but instead a second-order property: a property of concepts (Frege). second-order property of propositional functions, to say that dinosaurs do not exist is to say that the property of being a dinosaur is not instantiated; to say that Jean-Baptiste Botul does not exist is to say that some property—say, the property of being a unique post-war critic of Kant and father of Butolism—is not instantiated. In neither case is it to say of some individual that it does not exist, which neither Frege nor Russell thought made sense. The view that existence is not a property of individuals became the common view in the early 20th Century. the thought, developed most forcefully by Russell, that denying that existence is a first-order property is the only way to avoid the consequence that there are things that do not exist and thus that there is a distinction between being and existing, our second framing question from above.</p>

<p><strong>Position: Yes, existence is a property. There are things which do not exist.</strong></p>

<p>Argument: One can have an understanding of what a man or a phoenix is without knowing whether it exists. So, existence is something in addition to essence. Existence is not part of most objects’s natures and so those objects can be conceived or thought of separately from their existing. (Aquinas)</p>

<p>Existence is a genuine property of individuals but not universally had (Meinong)</p>
<ul>
  <li>primary motivation is the puzzle of negative singular existentials—sentences that seem to truly assert the nonexistence of an individual, such as the sentence ‘Jean-Baptiste Botul does not exist’. In order to be true, it seems, the subject position must designate some entity of which nonexistence is truly predicated, in which case there are things—the designation of these singular terms—that do not exist. Frege and Russell, by contrast, take the same sentences to demonstrate that those expressions are not genuine singular terms at all and that negative existentials all have a general form, asserting the noninstantiation of a property.</li>
</ul>

<p>Absolutely everything exists.</p>

<p>A sentence like ‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ either expresses a fully articulate singular proposition and so is false, as in that case there is a referent of the subject-place singular term which exists, or does not express a truth evaluative proposition at all, as the singular term lacks a semantic content. In neither case is the sentence true. Avoiding that consequence was a primary motivation behind all of the alternative accounts discussed in the previous two sections.
    +  The first challenge facing a proponent of such a view, then, is to explain how sentences like ‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ are both meaningful and sometimes apparently true without abandoning the theses that absolutely everything exists and that all names are devices of direct reference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kripe: ‘Ronald McDonald’ refer to existent, albeit abstract, fictional characters. Fictional characters have both being and existence. On this view, then, there are no genuinely true singular negative existentials. what a speaker means when she utters the sentence ‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ is not the false proposition that that sentence expresses but instead the true proposition that (the fictional character) Ronald McDonald is not a real person or is not concrete. Indeed, this is suggested by the natural amendment, ‘‘Ronald McDonald does not exist; he’s a creation of advertisement!’’</li>
</ul>

<p>All meaningful singular existentials are true and their negations false. We mistakenly take some singular negative existentials to be true because we conflate or do not sharply distinguish existing from being concrete. The benefit of this account is the simple semantics of proper names and the sparse metaphysics. The cost is revisionism regarding what we mean when we use apparently true singular negative existentials.</p>

<h1 id="universals-and-properties">Universals and Properties</h1>

<p><strong>Should the properties an object has in common with other objects, such as color and shape, be considered to exist beyond those objects? And if a property exists separately from objects, what is the nature of that existence?</strong></p>

<p>Universals are qualities or relations found in two or more entities. As an example, if all cup holders are circular in some way, circularity may be considered a universal property of cup holders. Further, if two daughters can be considered female offspring of Frank, the qualities of being female, offspring, and of Frank, are universal properties of the two daughters. Many properties can be universal: being human, red, male or female, liquid or solid, big or small, etc.</p>

<p>Philosophers agree that human beings can talk and think about universals, but disagree on whether universals exist in reality beyond mere thought and speech.</p>

<p>The problem of universals is specifically accounting for the fact that some things are of the same type. For example, Fluffy and Kitzler are both cats, or, the fact that certain properties are repeatable, such as: the grass, the shirt, and Kermit the Frog are green.</p>

<p>One wants to know by virtue of what are Fluffy and Kitzler both cats, and what makes the grass, the shirt, and Kermit green?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Platonist argument: universals are required for certain general words to have meaning and for the sentences in which they occur to be true or false. Take the sentence “Djivan Gasparyan is a musician” for instance. The realist may claim that this sentence is only meaningful and expresses a truth because there is an individual, Djivan Gasparyan, who possesses a certain quality: musicianship. Therefore, it is assumed that the property is a universal which is distinct from the particular individual who has the property.
The Platonist answer is that all the green things are green in virtue of the existence of a universal: a single abstract thing that, in this case, is a part of all the green things. With respect to the color of the grass, the shirt and Kermit, one of their parts is identical. In this respect, the three parts are literally one. Greenness is repeatable because there is one thing that manifests itself wherever there are green things.
    <ul>
      <li>But where?<br />
  Plato famously held, on one interpretation, that there is a realm of abstract forms or universals apart from the physical world (see theory of the forms). Particular physical objects merely exemplify or instantiate the universal.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Nominalism arose in reaction to this problem. It denies</p>

<p>Existence as what is expressed by the existential quantifier.</p>

<p>The view that there are non-existent objects.</p>

<p>Quine view of ontology.</p>

<p>Internal vs external ontological questions.</p>

<h1 id="the-mind-body-problem">The Mind Body Problem</h1>

<p>plato: chariot matephor
aristotle: soul has three parts: growth/nutrition shared with plants, perception shared with animals and reason which is unique to human beings. Things have a Form and function, Purposive and intelligent</p>

<p>materialism: pre-socratic philosophers, epicurus, galileo (who wanted to focus on size, shape, color, measurable quantifiable things as being explanations for things which are qualitative (taste, feelings, etc.) , descartes (who defended galileo by compatmentalizing mind/soul as a separate domain, and emphasized maths + observation as a basis for knowing the empirical world - radical idea at time (why should math tell you anything?))</p>

<p>christian church: attack against eternal truths (and the soul which is in contact with it)</p>

<p>william blake (not christian): leaves out so much: beauty, imagination etc.</p>

<p>kant: reconciling materialism with moral experience, in particular free will.</p>

<p>diderot: mind is a hapsichord which plays itsef, a book which writes on itself</p>

<p>churchlands: we can completely replace psychological language by materialist language. 
against: our rich vocabulatory helps us in explaining behavior, predictiong what others would do etc. it cannot be replaced.</p>

<p>Epiphemenalism: if you really introspect, most of the things we do are automatic</p>

<p>challenge: top-down causation, as the mind and will causing things in the physical world (as opposed to epiphenomentalism)</p>

<h1 id="time">Time</h1>

<p><strong>Is it absurd to suppose that only the present exists?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To say that only present exists, is that the only thing in our world is there here and now, and any talk about the past or the future is much like a fictional talk, which has its referent as something which doesn’t exist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>McTaggart’s proof about hte unreality of time: When McTaggart says ‘‘Time involves change’’, it seems like a sleight of hand. What does it mean? Time is the dimension of change. But that doesn’t make anything clearer.
We observe time through A series and B series, or we observe the dimension of change through A series and B series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does tense indicate a feature of the world? Do tensed statements have tenseless truth conditions? Would that show that tense is unreal?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can later events affect earlier events? Is Time Travel possible?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="persistence-through-time">Persistence Through Time</h1>

<p><strong>Material objects extend through space by having different spatial parts in different places. But how do they persist through time? According to some philosophers, things have temporal parts as well as spatial parts</strong></p>

<p>If you have different temporal parts, this would explain how you can exist at different times, and it would also explain how you can have different properties at different times (you-yesterday hasn’t heard of temporal parts, you-tomorrow is an expert)</p>

<p>** can we give criteria of identity through time for artefacts, animals or people? What happens to a ship if you replace all of its planks one by one? What if you keep the old planks, then build a new ship out of them?** In addressing these questions during recent decades, however, it has proven useful to discuss whether objects have temporal parts, because the answers that philosophers give to these questions can often depend upon whether they believe in temporal parts.</p>

<h1 id="causation--determinism-and-free-will">Causation,  Determinism and Free Will</h1>

<p><strong>Is causation analyzable in terms of counterfactuals?</strong></p>

<p>The simplest analysis analysis through counterfactuals would be :</p>

<p>Event c was a cause of event e if and only if c occurred and e occurred and if c had not occurred, then e would not have occurred.</p>

<p>Determinism: The world is governed by (or is under the sway of) determinism if and only if, given a specified way things are at a time t, the way things go thereafter is fixed as a matter of natural law</p>

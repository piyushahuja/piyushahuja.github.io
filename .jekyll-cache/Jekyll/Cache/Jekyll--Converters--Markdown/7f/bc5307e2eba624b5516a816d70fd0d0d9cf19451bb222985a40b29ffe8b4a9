I"<CENTER><h1 class="emphnext">Things I Love</h1></CENTER>

<p>I’m always hesitate to share such lists: would I continue loving the things I love now, or would it change? Do the things I love say something about my essence, or are they a result of whimsy, chance and happenstance?</p>

<p>The things we love can reveal aspects of our interior lives  in a way that any biography or self-description cannot.</p>

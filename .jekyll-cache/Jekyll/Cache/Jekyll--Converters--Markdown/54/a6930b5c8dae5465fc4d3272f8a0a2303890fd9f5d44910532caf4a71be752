<p><strong>Counting Pulses</strong></p>

<p>Norman Moore tells us in The Fitz-Patrick Lectures of 1905:</p>

<p>In medicine he introduced an improvement which in an altered form has continued in use to this day. This improvement was the counting of the pulse which up to his time had been felt and discussed in many ways but never counted. ‚Ä¶Nicholas of Cusa proposed to compare the rate of pulses by weighing the quantity of water run out of a water clock while the pulse beat one hundred times. ‚Ä¶The manufacture of watches with second-hands has since given us a simpler method of counting, but the merit of introducing this useful kind of observation into clinical medicine belongs to Nicholas of Cusa</p>

<p><strong>Ayurveda</strong></p>

<p>Dosha balance is emphasized, and suppressing natural urges is considered unhealthy and claimed to lead to illness. Ayurveda treatises describe three elemental doshas viz. vƒÅta, pitta and kapha, and state that balance (Skt. sƒÅmyatva) of the doshas results in health, while imbalance (vi·π£amatva) results in disease. Ayurveda treatises divide medicine into eight canonical components.</p>

<p><strong>Accupressure</strong></p>

<p>It is based on the concept of life energy which flows through ‚Äúmeridians‚Äù in the body. In treatment, physical pressure is applied to acupuncture points or ashi trigger points with the aim of clearing blockages in these meridians. Pressure may be applied by hand, by elbow, or with various devices</p>

<p><strong>Chinese Medicine</strong></p>

<p>One of the basic tenets is that the body‚Äôs vital energy (ch‚Äôi or qi) is circulating through channels called meridians having branches connected to bodily organs and functions.The concept of vital energy is pseudoscientific. Concepts of the body and of disease used in TCM reflect its ancient origins and its emphasis on dynamic processes over material structure, similar to the humoral theory of ancient Greece and ancient Rome.</p>

<p><strong>Humourism</strong></p>

<p>The concept of ‚Äúhumors‚Äù (chemical systems regulating human behaviour) became more prominent from the writing of medical theorist Alcmaeon of Croton (c. 540‚Äì500 BC). His list of humors was longer and included fundamental elements described by Empedocles, such as water, air, earth, fire, etc.. The concept of ‚Äúhumors‚Äù may have origins in Ancient Egyptian medicine, or Mesopotamia, though it was not systemized until ancient Greek thinkers. The word humor is a translation of Greek œáœÖŒºœåœÇ, chymos (literally juice or sap, metaphorically flavor). Ancient Indian Ayurveda medicine had developed a theory of three doshas (do·π£as), which they linked with the five elements (pa√±ca-bh≈´ta): earth, water, fire, air, and space</p>

<p><strong>Germ Theory</strong></p>

<p>The germ theory of disease is the currently accepted scientific theory for many diseases. It states that microorganisms known as pathogens or ‚Äúgerms‚Äù can lead to disease. These small organisms, too small to be seen without magnification, invade humans, other animals, and other living hosts. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause disease. ‚ÄúGerm‚Äù refers to not just a bacterium but to any type of microorganism, such as protists or fungi, or even non-living pathogens that can cause disease, such as viruses, prions, or viroids.[ Diseases caused by pathogens are called infectious diseases. Even when a pathogen is the principal cause of a disease, environmental and hereditary factors often influence the severity of the disease, and whether a potential host individual becomes infected when exposed to the pathogen. Pathogens are disease-carrying agents that can pass from one individual to another, both in humans and animals. Infectious diseases are caused by biological agents such as pathogenic microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) as well as parasites.</p>

<p>Basic forms of germ theory were proposed by Girolamo Fracastoro in 1546, and expanded upon by Marcus von Plenciz in 1762. However, such views were held in disdain in Europe, where Galen‚Äôs miasma theory remained dominant among scientists and doctors.</p>

<p>By the early 19th century, smallpox vaccination was commonplace in Europe, though doctors were unaware of how it worked or how to extend the principle to other diseases. A transitional period began in the late 1850s with the work of Louis Pasteur. This work was later extended by Robert Koch in the 1880s. By the end of that decade, the miasma theory was struggling to compete with the germ theory of disease. Viruses were initially discovered in the 1890s. Eventually, a ‚Äúgolden era‚Äù of bacteriology ensued, during which the germ theory quickly led to the identification of the actual organisms that cause many diseases</p>

<p><strong>EEG</strong></p>

<p>Hans Berger, the inventor of the electroencephalogram (EEG), has one of the most fascinating origin stories in the history of neuroscience‚Äîone that involves a strange premonition.</p>

<p>In 1892, Berger was a young German soldier performing his military service. One day, while stationed in W√ºrzburg, he was assigned to a dangerous task involving horse artillery. In a freak accident, his horse suddenly reared up, throwing him off and nearly trampling him. He narrowly escaped death.</p>

<p>At that exact moment, miles away in his hometown, Berger‚Äôs sister had a sudden and overwhelming feeling that something terrible had happened to him. She was so distressed that she convinced their father to send him a telegram, asking if he was safe. Berger later recalled this event as a turning point in his life. He was deeply shaken by the apparent telepathic connection between him and his sister.</p>

<p>This experience convinced Berger that human brains must be able to transmit signals, even at a distance. He became obsessed with finding a scientific explanation for thought transmission. Though he never proved telepathy, this led him to dedicate his career to studying the brain‚Äôs electrical activity.</p>

<p>Decades later, in 1924, Berger made his groundbreaking discovery‚Äîhe successfully recorded the first human EEG, detecting rhythmic electrical waves in the brain (which he called the ‚Äúalpha waves‚Äù). His work laid the foundation for modern neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces.</p>

<p>So, in a strange way, a brush with death and a moment of unexplained intuition led to one of the greatest breakthroughs in brain science.</p>

I"r<p><em>I must preface this entry by a disclaimer. I’ve been told, often by people whose judgements I trust, that I suffer from an affliction, an affliction which has irrevocably warped my view of the world. The affliction is this: I only see the good in people, events, and, by extension, places. I beg to differ, but I would admit this: Oxford is very different to different people, and what I present here might be the complete opposite of someone else’s view. Yet we must also keep in mind that how we construct meaning from experience is partly a choice, and maybe this is how I’ve chosen to experience it.</em></p>

I"z<p><strong>First-Time User Experience</strong></p>

<p>The goal of your first time user experience is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prevent them from abandoning the app</li>
  <li>Communicating your key value proposition in their heads</li>
  <li>Teaching them how to use the app.</li>
  <li>A set of clearly outlined steps to completion/registration is key for a successful FTUE. “uncertain, unexplained waits feel longer than known, finite waits.”  The more structured and clear the remaining time and number of steps remaining are, the more likely a user will be patient enough to go through and complete all of the steps required to get through the FTUE.</li>
  <li>Making them go “wow” . WOW is achieved when a user recognizes, either quite actively or subconsciously, that your product or service is a must have experience that will improve her life. It’s something powerful enough to make users say, “Wow, this is awesome.” Some things to keep in mind about WOW factors:
    <ul>
      <li>They’re often not a feature. But rather, what that feature makes possible.</li>
      <li>They convey much more value than effort required - (i.e. they are Low Effort, High Value, or LEHV, activities)</li>
      <li>They are powerful when communicated with examples or analogies, but even more powerful when the result of real user interaction. Do &gt; Show &gt; Tell.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

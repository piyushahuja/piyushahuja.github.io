<p><strong>July: The Initiation</strong></p>

<p>I felt the presence of the divine feminine. Her breasts grazed my chest. Her hair fell on my body. Her fragrance…</p>

<p>Love was in the air. In the energy field.</p>

<p>I saw a vision.It was the dawn of civilization. I was an one of the early men. I was Purush. I was Adam.  The land was densely forested, possibly Ancient India. I was unclothed. In the centre of my heart was the spiritual light I was carrying. And besides me was the community of other spiritual beings.</p>

<p>When the thought came as to what we have done,  to this planet, to ourselves, our burst into tears.</p>

<p>In those two hours, I let go of all the wounds, all the sadness that I carried, all the memories of rejection and heartache.</p>

<p>And when I emerged, I was alive, fresh, reborn, as I was when I was little.</p>

<p>We ate. Me in silence, others in playful.</p>

<p>A rainbow shone outside.</p>

<hr />

<p>For the next two weeks, I was on a high. I had vivid dreams. I uttered Sarah’s name in my sleep. I let go of any to-do list. I listend to LT music.</p>

<p>I bought a car. A Blue Volksvagen Tiguan. “Flirzy”, as Sarah would call it.</p>

<p>I wrote Sarah a letter in Cafe Chill, posted it via the post office next to Grafton, and refreshed the web page every day to check whether it has been received. It went on for 6-7 pages. It was “intense”, as she would describe later.</p>

<p>She replied immediately. A lukewarm one, to my dismay, but also to my expectation.  C’est Le Vie. Life goes on.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two months later, I drove into Earthspirit for the seminar. She wasn’t there.</p>

<p>I joined the training.</p>

<hr />

<p>On 8th November, 2011, I messaged Sarah, asking after her. She replied and suggested we chat on phone.</p>

<p>I was a little nervous calling but I manned up and took her offer. She was taking a walk outside the house. We chatted. We laughed.</p>

<p>Three days later, as I was switching off my phone for LT2, I left her a voice note, asking if she’d like to meet, never expecting she’d say Yes.  She did.</p>

<hr />

<p>On my way to Burnley, I stopped by Oxford. I bought her a book. We spoke on phone. She was loving. She said I’d be loved and fed.</p>

<hr />

<p>She was dressed in all black jeans and top as she stood in the doorway and looked around for me. She failed to spot me even though I was right there.</p>

<p>We chatted.</p>

<p>She proposed we try dancing, Cha-cha or something, that she was learning through videos on her iPAD.</p>

<p>That night, we made love.</p>

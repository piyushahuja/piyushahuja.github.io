I"Ç_<p>There is a â€œway of beâ€ in the world that is tantric.</p>

<p>It is non-reactive and relaxed.
It feels effortless, free, in the â€œflow of lifeâ€, genuine, authentic, â€œin integrityâ€.
All emotions are welcome, including: fear, anger, sadness (to investigate: what about â€œstressâ€, â€œanxietyâ€, â€œnervousnessâ€, â€œjealousyâ€). 
It has heightened awareness of your own emotions, your senses. 
You see reality â€œas isâ€, including the emotions of others. 
You have needs, but you are not â€œneedyâ€. You are not in a â€œgettingâ€ state. 
You give freeily, but do not â€œgive to getâ€.
You are able to play and take risks.</p>

<p><strong>Where Anxiety Comes From</strong></p>

<p>Often I criticize myself for not being socially savvy, for not being able to make small talk or have conversations with beautiful women. But the reason I feel uncomfortable to talk to certain woman have nothing to do with ability, but often about the cues that I have subconsciously picked up on how the other personâ€™s attitutde towards me.</p>

<p>Example: After the men-women reunion, I felt comfortable talking to Sarah, Kathy, Vanese, Stella, but not with Ingrid, Katie, Rosie etc. This was entirely due on them, and nothing to do with me. All these other women had done or said something that made me feel â€œunsafeâ€, â€œjudgedâ€. This could be as little as looking away when I looked at them, or a remark, or a disconnected/dismissive response when I said something vulnerable, or something in their body language or energy.</p>

<p>It might be good to bring these cues to awareness, so that I communicate.</p>

<hr />

<p>But the same goes the other way: often others might not feel safe around you if you hold a judgement about them. You might not be aware of the judgement, or you might be aware but think it is private, but it is very noticable to the other. This is an example of where the energetic realm is different from the physical realm.</p>

<hr />

<p>Apart from your judgements, others might not feel safe around you if you cross their unspoken boundaries. Which is why it is important toâ€¦</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Err on the side of asking about boundaries</strong></p>

<p>Erring on the side of asking for permission always works: â€œWould you be comfortable texting?â€ rather than assuming one way or the other. If i assume too much, I might signal i am not good at boundaries, or am intrusive. If I assume too less, I might miss out on connection where possibility of connection exists.</p>

<ul>
  <li>May I hold your hand?</li>
  <li>Would you be comfortable talking about sexual matters?</li>
  <li>Would you be open to texting?</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p>Safety and Relaxation is not just about â€œnot-violating boundatiesâ€ in the negative sense, but about respecting them in a positive sense.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Claireâ€™ example, of where the other responded to her boundaries by saying â€œYou always have your Noâ€™sâ€ is an example where boundaries were not violated, but they made the partner feel unsafe.</li>
  <li>Reassure them that youâ€™re happy about their boundaries, not upset</li>
  <li>Lesson from Jo: If you are really not happy with some aspect of your partnerâ€™s boundaries, talk about it in a very respectful, compassionate manner. Dont joke around it, dont be passive about it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I have trauma informed patterns</strong></p>

<p>Truth is, I was in a very different state of mind (and feeling) when I started this journey than I am now. It is impossible to recall how I my internal experience of myself used to be, but I remember the facts clearly:</p>

<p>I broke down in tears after Vaneseâ€™s initiation in LT1. Slowly at first, then violently when I realized that my beloved doesnâ€™t care about me. It felt natural and cathartic, but it was a â€œtrauma response.â€ It triggered memories of not being loved, not being cared for, and of being abandoned. I had these thoughts : â€œThis, Again, Ofcourseâ€, â€œWould anyone ever love me?â€, â€œI have to live with this pattern foreverâ€.</p>

<p>I felt incredibly melancholic after the Men-Women reunion after LT1 in Florence House, after observing my beloved. Slowly at first, then back at the mattress. Mellower than the first, but this was also a â€œtrauma responseâ€ that reminded me of all previous instances of false hope.</p>

<p>At the end of LT1, I spoke to Sarah about â€œI am not someone on the marginâ€. It was completely informed by how I imagined she saw me, rather than how I was feeling. Her response â€œYou are engineer. You went to Oxfordâ€ makes sense now.</p>

<p>I â€œgot backâ€ at Rich after my initiation in LT2. At the time, I felt in my power and proud of myself. And though difficult to see, this was also â€œa trauma responseâ€.How? Although the response was informed by fear of â€œbeing bulliedâ€. it was authentic and in tune with how I was feeling. It was also controlled. What it did lack was a mindful awareness of my feeling. And it definitely lacked awareness of all the other ways I could have responded, or channeled my energy. It was reactive, it lacked mindful choice.</p>

<p>Would I have the same reaction if the same series of events were to happen to me now?</p>

<p>Possibly not. I have received loved by the one I so desired love from in my LT1, I was chosen by the one I desired in Florence House LT1, and I have received love from Jo. I am lovable, I can be loved, I have been loved, I am loved and I will be loved.</p>

<p>Do I still have trauma informed pattenrs?</p>

<p>One is the â€œfear of being taken for grantedâ€</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>When the inner critic is active, it reads a negative statement even in positive statements.</strong></p>

<p>When J observed â€œyouâ€™ve calmed downâ€, I received it as that she wants me to be more energetic. Whereas thats not what she meant; she wanted it slow.</p>

<p>When Serena started with â€œYou have a lovely voiceâ€, the inner critic was waiting for a â€œButâ€¦â€</p>

<p>When Zephyr set different boundaries for me and Andrew, the inner critic convinced me it was about me. (it was merely because she had worked with Andrew before)</p>

<p>When Sandra walked past in LT3, the inner critic started thinking she must have made a judgement (she just wasnâ€™t ready after having done cycles of relationship)</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Wheel of Consent</strong></p>

<p>An insight: an energetic transaction or exchange is not just about â€œgiveâ€
 and â€œtakeâ€, i.e. it is not single dimensional. One can â€œtakeâ€ by giving, and â€œgiveâ€ by takingâ€. It is two dimensional.</p>

<p>How does one give by taking? By taking from others for their own needs. By â€œallowingâ€ others to give. When I allow my parents to give me advice that I do not need, I make them feel valued. I â€œgive energyâ€ by â€œtakingâ€ advice. Similarly, when J served me down there, I â€œgave herâ€ (energetically) by taking (â€œphysicallyâ€).</p>

<p>How does one take (i.e. for them, meet their own needs) by giving (on the surface)?  When I â€œgive somethingâ€ to meet my own needs (of self-esteem, or feeling good about myself e.g.). Rescuing to feel good about myself would fall toin this category. A good example is me giving an orgasm to D, with her giving me instructions. I was â€œgivingâ€ (physically) but it was for my needs (to learn). At the same time, D was giving me (energetically), by â€œallowingâ€ me to give (physically).</p>

<p>Note that when one is taking (energetically) by giving (physically), the other is giving (energetically) by taking (physically).</p>

<p>Okay, so those are the counter-intutive ones. What about the straightforward ones?</p>

<p>How does one â€œgiveâ€ by â€œgivingâ€ then? When I give something to others, â€œfor othersâ€. For example, me giving an orgasm to J.</p>

<p>How does one â€œtakeâ€ (energetically) by â€œtakingâ€? When J and me did it in the morning. When S and I did it.</p>

<p>In negotiations and marketing, acting as if you are â€œfor the consumersâ€ or â€œfor the other partyâ€ while filling your own pockets is the norm. But when one does the same in interpersonal relationships, it translates to manipulative behavior.</p>

<p>It is useful to be aware of who is one acting for, energetically, when one does something physically.</p>

<p>Where does gratitude fit in?</p>

<p>Often when you give (energetically) to someone, there is gratitude at the other end. If there is no gratitude, the other did not â€œrecognizeâ€ it as a gift that was for them.</p>

<p>When you are giving, do you get upset when the gift is not appreciated?  When there is no gratitude? Then it was probably for you.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>I was amused when Clara reciprocated my energy. She gave back to my giving, I imagine for a sense of equality and â€œnot owingâ€ gratitude. She did not â€œappreciateâ€ my giving. But it did not cause me upset.</p>

<p>Richa does not show gratitude (for me agreeing to meet her). How does that make me feel? Confused, awkward, because she says she wants to meet, and I do it for her.</p>

<p>I was upset when Rosa didnt respond gracefully to the compliment. She did not give me gratitude. The compliment was probably â€œfor meâ€.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>The Realm of Energetic Exchange</strong></p>

<p>The wheel of consent is a clear example of how â€œenergyâ€ is a separate realm than the physical realm. It is the realm of consciousness, attention and intention.</p>

<p>The verbal realm is what people say. The physical one is what people do. But the energtic realm is what peopleâ€™s intentions and feelings are.</p>

<p>Operating in a different realm: the verbal one or the physical one, one can often end up either being manipulated, or being manipulative themselves.</p>

<p>When one does something differently from what they say, one separates their verbal and physical selves, and is out of integrity.</p>

<p>But when is out of tune with their energetic realm, and say and do differently from what they intend, one is also out of integrity. If I say I love you, and do end up loving them, but I dont feel the love, one is out of integrity with their self.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>I tend to invent stories that makes me look good to myself</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>â€œLaura  is secretly attracted to meâ€</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I switch to fault finding mode when I imagine someone looks down on me</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Zephyr lacks self-awareness (didnt meet me where I was), Zephy prioritizes connection with her needs to such an extend that she is disrespectful to the needs of others, Zephy is highschoolish, clique, immature etc.</li>
  <li>Vic fears vulnerability and has a wrong idea of what it means to be tantric (not lack of vulnerability, but comfort with it).</li>
  <li>Josh is unware of his own flaws and doesnt understand that more knowledge is supposed to make someone more humble and aware of what they dont know, rather than arrogant and superior. Me being inspired by him is not an invitation to be looked down upon.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Creating insecurity is manipulative. It can also backfire</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I did this when I said to S that â€œI am on a journey and I cannot say about the futureâ€ made S close down.</li>
  <li>I did this with J when I said â€œI am popular and would be snogging others and be sensitiveâ€ can make J close down.</li>

<hr />

<p><strong>People perceive qualities from your energy, not from your verbal or physical selves.</strong></p>

<p>It matters little what you actually say. J can say â€œBig Fucking Vibratorâ€ with a funny energy, and it would be damn funny.</p>

<p>No matter how you act big, people would still think the same of you. You have no control over how people see you, but only over your energy.</p>

<p>Lessons from Marriage</p>

<ul>
  <li>I need to see my wife at the end of the day</li>
  <li>I need communication on how your day is going</li>
  <li>I need sincere expressions of love (apart from any obligations)</li>
  <li>I want to feel needed. Or do I want to feel desired</li>
</ul>

<p>You have agreements, not boundaries for others</p>

<p>i remember back when i was going on dates that i was often in convincing mode: convincing her that iâ€™m interesting, that iâ€™m attentive, that iâ€™m accomplishednow iâ€™m not going on dates but when i do i wanna be like fuck that either you see me or you donâ€™t, your loss if you donâ€™t</p>

<p>the way i got out of that was . . . like being fucking kind to myself
Iâ€™m thinking the problem is that itâ€™s all about how the girl experiences it. I would try to reorganize this about how primarily you experience the interactions.like saying <em>my experience matters</em>. itâ€™s not good or cool or fair at all for me to feel this way. im not entitled to anything specific from any person or any society</p>

<p>my felt awareness/experience of the world expanded from</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>when around girl, she is all i can think about, i need to make her like me, thereâ€™s no one else
the phallusoraptors
@phallusoraptors
Â·</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>wow. i have my own life to go back to. my actual friends, my actual lovers, partners, they will take care of me. they are the ones expected to take care of me</p>

  <p>not this person. they just exist. but if we vibe, we might connect</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if you can remember your friends exist, and they still fundamentally are the ones to take care of you, any single interaction with a person becomes v low stakes
consider the girlâ€™s opportunity cost of not interacting with a cool person such as yourselfÂ </p>

<p>I did an online Authentic Communication course last year and Iâ€™m just reading through some of my notes about making requests. I thought the material was really useful for our LTT journeyâ€¦
Tips When Making Requests -
Separate the request from our sense of mattering (so hearing â€˜noâ€™ has no impact on our sense of whether we matter
Connect with our own experience of choice - the more choice we feel we have, the more choice we can give others
View requests as invitations to generosity 
Let go of the outcome and focus on the quality of connection
Learn to be at peace with unmet needs
Shift the focus from satisfying our needs to honouring and attending to our needs</p>

<p><strong>Attachment Theory</strong> (Seminar I)</p>

<p>Islands:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tend to like alone time (â€œI like to have my partner in the house but not in the roomâ€)</li>
  <li>A bit stressful to be close to other people</li>
  <li>Over reliance on self regulation</li>
  <li>Childhood: when you grew up, it would be about performance, to be â€œa certain wayâ€, to not disturb or embarrase care-giver</li>
  <li>Not good at expressing feelings</li>
  <li>Shame of not being good enough</li>
  <li>Low verbal/low expression</li>
  <li>Solitude -&gt; social/relational transitions are hard</li>
  <li>Shame around being needy or being in debt e.g. receiving presents is hard</li>
  <li>Need time to process</li>
  <li>Dont like why questions</li>
  <li>sense of being unlovable</li>
  <li>dislike conflict, brush it under the carpet, just move on</li>
  <li>find it difficult to ask for help</li>
</ul>

<p>e.g. Frieder, Luke, Sarah</p>

<p>How to make islands worse?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Calling their name from another room</li>
  <li>Holding them</li>
  <li>Asking them about their feelings (â€œFeels like a threatâ€)</li>
  <li>Giving them too much time alone</li>
</ul>

<p>How to make islands better?</p>
<ul>
  <li>making positive statements</li>
  <li>keepign words to a minimum</li>
  <li>giving them warnign when things are about to change</li>
  <li>know they have a need to distance and they will miss you</li>
</ul>

<p>Waves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Also focus on their own needs, but their needs are different</li>
  <li>Emotional Regulation is sought outside</li>
  <li>Expect to be disappoonte</li>
  <li>Get distressed because they expect upset</li>
  <li>Create drama to test if alright</li>
  <li>Long periods of contact</li>
  <li>A bit negative</li>
  <li>Insecure relationaly, separation anxiety</li>
  <li>Emotions go up and down</li>
  <li>Silence is a problem</li>
  <li>Seek conflict, keep coming back to it</li>
</ul>

<p>e.g. Richa, Ross</p>

<p>How to make waves worse?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Walking away from them</li>
  <li>Arguing with logic</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p>Anchors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tend to relate in a secure way</li>
  <li>Value relationship over everything else, even their own needs</li>
  <li>tend to be fully committed once they enter</li>
  <li>Unpredictable</li>
  <li>one can make them worse by not putting relationships first</li>
  <li>Need to be valued, concern for fairness/justice</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p>Dont talk about frameworks in real life dates.</p>

<p>I am interested in a relationship.
These are the things I need? Would you be willing to meet those?

<p><strong>Seminar II</strong></p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>What is the difference between â€œbeing safeâ€ and â€œfeeling safeâ€?</p>

<p>Feeling safe:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to be met without judgement</li>
  <li>to be resilient</li>
  <li>
    <p>What does safety look like?</p>
  </li>
  <li>People being present</li>
  <li>Having a physical space where I am protected</li>
</ul>

<p>What does feeling unsafe look like?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cannot trust yourself</li>
  <li>loss of control</li>
  <li>hearts racing</li>
  <li>eyes darting</li>
  <li>belly tense</li>
  <li>shaking in my legs</li>
</ul>

<p>What do I need to feel safe?</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you need space, I need to hear the reassurance that youâ€™d be back</li>
  <li>I need to know that youâ€™d say â€œNoâ€ when I am too close to you</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Parts Work</strong></p>

<p>Example:
Jessie, Lucy (Keep anger away in iceberg), Ginta (Need angry part to shut down inner critic)</p>

<p><strong>Controller</strong></p>

<p>Controller evolved when we were young, to make us feel safe, both from physical harm and to be in connection</p>

<p>As we grow up, we do not need it for the role it originally played</p>

<p>A controller is needed, but we need to change its job descriptin, to grow it to a higher version.  â€œYou will choose your people and choose your momentsâ€ where you can let it go</p>

<p>What does the controller do for you?</p>

<p>Autopilor Controller-produced defence mechanisms/ Strategies to feel safe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being good</li>
  <li>People pleasing</li>
  <li>Never crying</li>
  <li>Workaholic</li>
  <li>Planner</li>
  <li>Getting Angry</li>
  <li>Self Harm</li>
  <li>Addictions</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p>Controller prevents you from feeling hurt, being angry, focussed on target, v</p>

<p>The parts evolved at a particular stage of your life to serve you. All your parts serve you in some way.</p>

<p>How to do parts work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Think of a default part that comes out in difficult situations. How does it serve you? How does it not serve you?</li>
  <li>Think of its polarity: a different part that is the opposite. How can it serve you? How does it not serve you?</li>
  <li>See if the two parts require integration, communication, change in their job description</li>
  <li>When you judge others, which parts are you judging in them?</li>
  <li>If there is a part you would like to develop and listen to, choose one colour pen and let it write in your journal or use two chairs or cushions to switch between your full integrated self and the part you want to develop or listen to. if any parts caused problems for you, and if you need to boost any parts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example Insights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Socially Awkward part is able to connect with other socially awkward people</li>
  <li>Questioner doesnâ€™t actually serve connection: what it thinks it serves</li>
  <li>Maybe the witty conversationalists arent really connecting, because connection requires vulnerability</li>
  <li>Socially Awkard and Questioner can coexist.</li>
</ul>

  <p>There are not hundreds of millions of people in the world who walk outside every day wanting to meet somebody new that day. The excitement is around connecting people in a shared location such that IF they were to decide to meet in real life, they would be able to. This may not happen right after they connect online, but the possibility that they could is compelling for every person in the world. Human beings have an evolutionary urge to connect with other humans, in person, going back to clansmen survival instincts in the beginning of mankind. <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-close-is-anybody-to-solving-the-social-networking-problem-of-connecting-new-people">Evan Reas of Circle</a></p>

  <p>It is already happening. It will start to happen more in real time and live over the next few years because people have their location info with them all the time on their phones. Of important note is that the view that the holy grail is getting people to meet right here right now is wrong and that should be looked at as one necessary and awesome feature but not a killer application.</p>

  <li><strong>Not solving a real problem “pain point”</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>When people discuss the “meeting new people, in person, right now” problem, that is a very narrow feature of connecting new people and not one worth solving in itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>People do not want to just meet people. That’s not a pressing need.  “This is neat, but when I wake up Monday morning, I don’t have a pressing need to meet people around me randomly just because we have the same interests.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a small group of people that does want to meet someone right now (mostly, extremely gregarious young people or those trying to sell things), and there’s certain places (conferences are the best example) where it happens, but not for most people, most of the time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And that’s the problem with acquiring users as a people discovery app: providing a real utility that brings people back for more. “A lot of these apps come from a problem that 99 percent of people don’t have,” Kirill Sheynkman, Senior Managing Director at RTP Ventures says.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The examples where connecting new people within a location is working best are:</p>

<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>New people are already connected across multiple huge social platforms. 
Twitter is one of the best examples. Twitter has an “interest graph” which connects new people that have similar interests (I’m using “new” to mean people that don’t already know each other outside of the internet). Craigslist connects new people for commerce. AirBnB connects new people for room-sharing. Reddit connects new people for interesting content and discussion. The list goes on… Some of those sites are not location-dependent and some are.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For providing a real utility,  you need to identify what people want.   You  to better understand our user’s needs, and help them fulfill those needs. Recently, there have been numerous location based networks growing quickly that connect new people in a shared location. Each have a different take on exactly how they are connecting people. None of the ones that are taking off are simply about “meet somebody new that you walk nearby now!”  This is too big of a behavioral change and isn’t compelling for enough people currently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Similar Interests</strong> Do people want to meet people who have similar interests?  For two people to connect, do they need to have overlapping needs, desires, or wants?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The social overlap between users can act as the lubricant that facilitates meeting, but it alone won’t compel two strangers to meet.  Prompting me to talk to someone nearby because we share two friends in common and both are into kite surfing will never be a compelling enough reason for me to reach out to and connect with a complete stranger in life. Highlight, Sonar and Banjo are of that variety and will not takeoff anytime soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Another would be two people who can help each other professionally (Networking).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the course of working on Meeteor that professional networking was similar to dating. People were afraid to approach people that were professionally “out of their league. People are still very protective of their private identities on Facebook. Nobody wanted to make professional connections through their Facebook profiles.The next generation of social networkers may not need separate personal and professional identities, but the current one does.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Two people looking to date. Within dating, a niche sectior - lesbians, muslims, gays, Indian diasporta etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two people looking to hookup</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two people who can help each other are examples of mutual overlap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two Moms</p>

  <li>
    <p>NextDoor, a site that connects neighbors to discuss ongoings in their neighborhood.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.quora.com/topic/Circle-app">Circle</a>, the Local Network will also connect new people through content and information in their local community. From our beta testing in Chicago, people 1) love it and 2) are connecting with others in their own local communities in ways they have never done before.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Traffic Tips</strong> Waze, a navigation app that connects you with people near you for traffic tips. Interestingly, you can also chat with people, get ranked against them and other local connecting features.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>On-Demand</strong> Tonight, a feature that allows users to essentially order a date on-demand. users can opt-in for a date tonight, put in a specific time, and HowAboutWe will search through your potential matches for people who’ve also opted in for a date tonight. In about five minutes, according to the company, HAW will send a push notification asking users to look at their potential dates and double-tap on the ones that they’d like to go out with. Once all interested parties have made their selections, HAW matches them up with the best fit based on various factors and sends both users into a text conversation. All messages go through a HAW number so that users’ phone numbers aren’t automatically shared. The core function behind Lovestruck is the ‘free for’ feature. It lets you change your profile on a daily basis to let potential matches know whether you’re “Free for Lunch” or “Free Tonight” and it really promotes spontaneous dates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kayla finds it more difficult to make friends than meet potential significant others. “I want to be friends with a lot of girls, like the girl who does my manicures or one of my yoga teachers, but I don’t know how to ask them to hang out in a way that’s not asking them on a date. Plus, men walk up to you at bars, in clubs and grocery stores, completely unsolicited, because their biological drives are motivating them. Potential friends aren’t going to do that,” she said.</p>

  <p>Tara had struck gold. After spending a lazy Saturday afternoon browsing through the dating app she was currently experimenting with, she hit it off with a nice-sounding guy, and the two exchanged real names and numbers. She found herself Googling Stuart*, a Brit living in Amsterdam. He worked at a startup; he was visiting New York on business. “I was like, oh, he’s kind of cute…” Neither had plans that night, so they started figuring out where they could meet up for a drink. When Tara suggested a restaurant in midtown Manhattan, Stuart was into it: “Okay cool, my hotel is super close to there,” he messaged back. The mention of the hotel gave Tara pause, and she asked him what exactly he had in mind. “We can go back after and have some fun,” he said. Tara hesitated. This guy seemed nice and normal and safe and she was down for a fun night out with a visiting stranger, but she drew a hard line when it came to sex on the first date. “I was like, ‘Listen, I don’t know who you’ve met [on this app], but I’m not going to fuck you, I’m sorry,’” she says. Her match was taken aback. “Oh,” he responded. “I thought that was the expectation.” These kinds of conflicting agendas will be familiar to anyone who’s done much Tindering or Bumbling or OkCupiding, where one person’s one-night stand is another person’s chance at finding The One. But Tara wasn’t using any of these apps. This was Ohlala, and Stuart had already agreed to pay Tara $600 for their date.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People are often very very closed about confronting on the part if they are looking for a serious or a casual relationship. Which makes matter worse. Expecting that since you are coming from dating site, you will be ready for sex.</p>

<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A good way is “Setting your mode” I am in Networking Mode/Dating Mode etc./Free for etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Agree Upfront</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Poppenreiter, Ohlala seeks to improve upon two perceived flaws that Tinder and other dating apps often fall into. First, the in-app chats that go nowhere — or worse, promising matches who ghost on you. As more results-oriented users of Tinder or OkCupid can attest, if you’ve logged on with the objective to meet up with someone that night, you can often be left frustrated. With Ohlala, everyone wants something, and everyone’s on a tight schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Phone Batteries From Continously Gathering Location Data</strong></p>

  <p>Highlight killed phone batteries, it made some people uncomfortable, and the connections it engineered weren’t great matches.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Critical Mass Problem</strong>  These apps need strong network effects to provide real utility to people who do want to meet people.  the problem with Loopt, and any of the other services like Whrrl or Brightkite which popped up at this time, was two fold:  The social graph was still relatively small. The average number of Facebook friends was around 150-200. Now it’s closer to 450-500. That has created way more ‘connection’ opportunities.  iOS device adaption was still small compared to the overall population. iOS and Android market share has dramatically improved. At the time with the earliest adaptors on the device it wasn’t enough critical mass for the early movers to dominate the space. <a href="https://www.startupgrind.com/blog/3-horse-race-for-meet-new-people-space-highlight-banjo-lals-circle/">The Problem with Highlight, Banjo, Circle, Loops</a></li>

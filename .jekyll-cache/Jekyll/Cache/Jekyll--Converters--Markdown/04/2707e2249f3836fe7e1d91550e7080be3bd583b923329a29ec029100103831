I"a<p>They love me…they love me not.</p>

<p>By now I have a pretty good handle on the question. I don’t have to pick the petals of a poor flower: my body could tell.</p>

<p>“<em>You sort of know…don’t you”</em> said my friend Dawne. That you just <em>know</em> whether you’d hit it off with someone - pre-communication, pre-familiarity, pre- any dating rituals - was an idea that wafted through my skeptical mind - completely bypassed it - and struck a chord in the same area where the knowingness resided. It was true and I just knew it.</p>

<p>But have there been times when I sort of “just knew” that it wouldn’t happen, when it eventually did? When my gut instinct has been wrong?</p>

<p>This is my attempt to reflect on the times I’ve felt loved, or acutely felt the absence of it, and everything in between.</p>

I"*<p>Log likelihood jumps out everywhere in ML, occupying a place of prominence similar to what $\pi$ has in geometry. Is it just just a computational trick that makes  dealing with probabilities tractable?  It turns out  but a natural consequence of this principle that underpins all modern ML:</p>

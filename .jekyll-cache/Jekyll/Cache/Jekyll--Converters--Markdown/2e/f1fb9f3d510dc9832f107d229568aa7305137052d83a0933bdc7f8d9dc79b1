I"ý<p><strong>The Initiation</strong></p>

<p>I felt the presence of the divine feminine. Her breasts grazed my chest. Her hair fell on my body. Her fragranceâ€¦</p>

<p>Love was in the air. In the energy field.</p>

<p>I saw a vision.It was the dawn of civilization. I was an one of the early men. I was Purush. I was Adam.  The land was densely forested, possibly Ancient India. I was unclothed. In the centre of my heart was the spiritual light I was carrying. And besides me was the community of other spiritual beings.</p>

<p>When the thought came as to what we have done,  to this planet, to ourselves, our burst into tears.</p>

<p>In those two hours, I let go of all the wounds, all the sadness that I carried, all the memories of rejection and heartache.</p>

<p>And when I emerged, I was alive, fresh, reborn, as I was when I was little.</p>

<p>We ate. Me in silence, others in playful.</p>

<p>A rainbow shone outside.</p>

<p>For the next two weeks, I was on a high. I had vivid dreams. I uttered Sarahâ€™s name in my sleep. I let go of any to-do list. I listend to LT music.</p>

<p>I wrote Sarah a letter in Cafe Chill, posted it via the post office next to Grafton, and refreshed the web page every day to check whether it has been received.</p>

<p>AIMO Prize: The AIMO Prize is a $10mn challenge fund, founded and supported by XTX Markets, designed to spur the open development of AI models that can reason mathematically, leading to the creation of a publicly shared AI model capable of winning a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). A grand prize of $5M will be awarded to whoever can create an AI model that can win a gold medal in the IMO</p>

<p>The first progress prize included problems at intermediate-level high school mathematics competitions, tricky math problems written in LaTeX format, high school students use to train for the International Math Olympiad. This competition includes 110 problems similar to an intermediate-level high school math challenge. The dataset encompasses a range of difficulty levels, from simple arithmetic to algebraic thinking and geometric reasoning.</p>

<p>A unique dataset of 800k+ competitive level problems and solutions was a key success factor for winning and we are thrilled to release it to the public. We now look forward to seeing far better models built upon the Numina dataset.The Gemma 7B benchmark for these problems is 3/50 on the public and private test sets  29 out of 50 problems on the private test set.</p>

  <li>A novel decoding algorithm for tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) with code execution feedback to generate solution candidates during inference</li>
  <li>A variety of internal validation sets that we used to guide model selection and avoid overfitting to the public leaderboard.</li>

</ul>

<p>Major challenge: The assessment of AI models‚Äô mathematical reasoning skills faces a significant hurdle, the issue of train-test leakage. Models trained on Internet-scale datasets may inadvertently encounter test questions during training, skewing the evaluation process.</p>

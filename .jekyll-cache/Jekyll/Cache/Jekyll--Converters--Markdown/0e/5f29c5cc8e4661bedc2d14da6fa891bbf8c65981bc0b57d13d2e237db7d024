<p>People mount /dev/log into a container, or send logs to logger daemon or /dev/null. You probably want to store logs externally: in a volume or mounted host directory, and have a separate container take care of logs.
Or use Log Rotate.</p>

<p>Containers are no vm’s, if you have to log in on a container running in production - you’re doing something wrong - unless that container’s only job is running SSH (which can be useful for example for Jenkins build slaves).</p>

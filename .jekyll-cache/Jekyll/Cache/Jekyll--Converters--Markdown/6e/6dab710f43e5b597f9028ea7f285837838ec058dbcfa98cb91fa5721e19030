I"Ð<p>First and foremost, and this is very long-term, I want to write a novel. A good novel. Why, even a great novel! -  like one which would have words like â€˜ambitious, philosophical, unique, masterpiece, expansive, mind-expanding, human conditionâ€™ etc. in its reviews. I feel, perhaps foolishly, that I have a unique view of the world, that I can see truths others donâ€™t see, that I have ideas - good ideas - which few others, if any, would have. It would be a pity to leave this world without having left my imprint, without having revealed or exposed the truths I see, or let the ideas I have influence the way the world I leave behind. Actually, this is what all art is all about, and although this desire to give a form and expression to your ideas can be satisfied through music or movies or paintings and many other outlets, writing is the one which I have a strong <em>feel</em> for. I remember, as a kid, sitting on the floor at the second storey of our Sector 6 bungalow, writing on a blank A4 sheet of paper the story of my day. I remember spending a summer vacation filling a whole notebook with a fictional story about space villains - inspired by <em>Captain Vyom</em>. I remember reciting my <em>surprisingly-good-in-hindsight</em> poem, â€˜<em>Veer Jawan, Tujhe Salam</em>â€™, to hospitalized Kargil war veterans (Little Angels), and writing even more terrible poems for my creative writing class (Bhawan Vidyalaya) and the school magazine (St. Johnâ€™s). My urge to write persisted through primary school, middle school, high school and college.  Writing, in short, is something which I have always had a desire for - it goes as far back as I can remember, so this is a desire unadulterated by any want of wealth, fame or power. And soâ€¦ I want to spend my time reading great literature and good writers. I want to write with style, vigour and vibrancy. I want to write with humour. And I want to convert all the seemingly good ideas I have to words, every day, every time.</p>

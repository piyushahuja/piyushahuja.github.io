<p>Purpose: <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/05/20/good-writing-vs-talented-writing/">Good Writing vs Talented Writing</a></p>

<p>Writing well in the sense of writing something interesting and urgent and alive, that actually has calories in it for the reader â€” the reader walks away having benefited from the 45 minutes she put into reading the thing â€” maybe isnâ€™t hard for a certain few. I mean, maybe John Updikeâ€™s first drafts are these incredible . . . Apparently Bertrand Russell could just simply sit down and do this. I donâ€™t know anyone who can do that. For me, the clichÃ© that â€œWriting that appears effortless takes the most workâ€ has been borne out through very unpleasant experience.</p>

<p>In the broadest possible sense, writing well means to communicate clearly and interestingly and in a way that feels alive to the reader. Where thereâ€™s some kind of relationship between the writer and the reader â€” even though itâ€™s mediated by a kind of text â€” thereâ€™s an electricity about it.</p>

<p>In my experience with studentsâ€”talented students of writing â€” the most important thing for them to remember is that someone who is not them and cannot read their mind is going to have to read this. In order to write effectively, you donâ€™t pretend itâ€™s a letter to some individual you know, but you never forget that what youâ€™re engaged in is a communication to another human being. The bromide associated with this is that the reader cannot read your mind. The reader cannot read your mind. That would be the biggest one.
Probably the second biggest one is learning to pay attention in different ways. Not just reading a lot, but paying attention to the way the sentences are put together, the clauses are joined, the way the sentences go to make up a paragraph.</p>

<p>The writing writing that I do is longhand. . . . The first two or three drafts are always longhand. . . . I can type very much faster than I can write. And writing makes me slow down in a way that helps me pay attention.</p>

<p>One of the things thatâ€™s good about writing and practicing writing is itâ€™s a great remedy for my natural self-involvement and self-centeredness. . . . When students snap to the fact that thereâ€™s such a thing as a really bad writer, a pretty good writer, a great writer â€” when they start wanting to get better â€” they start realizing that really learning how to write effectively is, in fact, probably more of a matter of spirit than it is of intellect. I think probably even of verbal facility. And the spirit means I never forget thereâ€™s someone on the end of the line, that I owe that person certain allegiances, that Iâ€™m sending that person all kinds of messages, only some of which have to do with the actual content of what it is Iâ€™m trying to say.</p>

<p>â€œI am not, in and of myself, interesting to a reader. If I want to seem interesting, work has to be done in order to make myself interesting.â€</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a certain amount of stuff about writing thatâ€™s like music or math or certain kinds of sports. Some people really have a knack for this. . . . One of the exciting things about teaching college is you see a couple of them every semester. Theyâ€™re not always the best writers in the room because the other part of it is it takes a heck of a lot of practice. Gifted, really really gifted writers pick stuff up quicker, but they also usually have a great deal more ego invested in what they write and tend to be more difficult to teach. . . .
Good writing isnâ€™t a science. Itâ€™s an art, and the horizon is infinite. You can always get better.</p>

<p>But one of the things I end up saying to the students is, â€œRealize your professors are human beings. Theyâ€™re reading these things really fast, but youâ€™re often being graded down for reasons that the professor isnâ€™t consciously aware of because of an immense amount of reading and an immense amount of evaluation of the quality of a piece of writing, the qualities of the person producing it, occur below, just below, the level of consciousness, which is really the way you want it. And one of the things that really good writing does is that itâ€™s able to get across massive amounts of information and various favorable impressions of the communicator with minimal effort on the part of the reader.â€</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why people use terms like flow or effortless to describe writing that they regard as really superb. Theyâ€™re not saying effortless in terms of it didnâ€™t seem like the writer spent any work. It simply requires no effort to read itâ€” the same way listening to an incredible storyteller talk out loud requires no effort to pay attention. Whereas when youâ€™re bored, youâ€™re conscious of how much effort is required to pay attention. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Which doesnâ€™t mean such creatures are born, but it does mean thatâ€™s why practicing and paying attention never stop being important. Right? Itâ€™s because weâ€™re training the same part of us that knows how to</p>

<hr />

<p>The writer tries to move stuff from his brain into the brains of his readers, using words as his only tools. Good writing doesnâ€™t just transport ideasâ€”it gives the reader a visceral experience, as if the writer is reaching inside his skull, grabbing fistfuls of neurons, twisting them, petting them, and sometimes crushing them.Â </p>

<hr />

<p>My subjective take is that good writing is diverting while great writing is haunting. Both must be sensual, but good writing will give me a thrill and then pretty much leave my brain the moment after Iâ€™ve read the last sentence. Whereas great writing will itch at me for years.</p>

<p>This generally means the writer has solved one of the hardest narrative problems: injecting the perfect amount of ambiguity into his prose. Too little and it will only be diverting, because without ambiguity, it will answer all its questions, leaving me with none. Too much and Iâ€™ll be confused, not haunted. Just as too little shuts a door at the end, too much makes me slam the door in bewilderment: â€œI have no idea what to think, so Iâ€™m not going to think at all.â€</p>

<p>Even if we all agreed that ambiguity is the key to good vs great, we wouldnâ€™t all agree that specific works had the right amount of it. â€œ2001: a Space Odysseyâ€ is a classic example. For me, its level of ambiguity is perfect: an drop more and I would have been too baffled to enjoy the experience; with less, it might have been a fun sci-fi flick, but I wouldnâ€™t still be thinking about it, nearly fifty years after first seeing it.</p>

<p>But I know plenty of folksâ€“people who agree with me that ambiguity is vital to great storytellingâ€“who think the film is too ambiguous and simply find it irritating or boring.</p>

<p>Hamletâ€™s famous soliloquy is another example of writing that haunts me. Itâ€™s full of great images, such as grunting and sweating under a weary life; its contains sonorous language, such as â€œto die, to sleep, to sleep perchance to dreamâ€¦â€ But most important to me is its ambiguity. Itâ€™s not nonsensical. We know what Hamlet is talking about. We know heâ€™s trying to decide whether or not to take action against his uncle.</p>

<p>But there are so many questions: what does he mean when he lists one of his options as â€œto take arms against as sea of troubles and by opposing end them? Are â€œthe sea of troublesâ€ his uncle and the situation and court, and by taking arms against them, does he mean murder? Or is he talking about suicide? Taking arms against himself and, thus, ending his troubles? Does he imagine that if he takes arms against his uncle, heâ€™ll end his troubles by ascending to the throne that is rightfully his? Or does he mean that heâ€™ll end them by getting killed in the process?</p>

<p>Great writingâ€“to meâ€“contains prose that evokes sensual experiencesâ€“for meâ€“and which has a level of ambiguity that haunts me for years without having so much ambiguity that it simply becomes nonsense.</p>

<p>If you held a gun to my head and forced me to concoct a less personal, more objective, definition of â€œgreat writing,â€ the best I could do would be to list highly influential books. They would be great in the sense of having great impact. Alternatively, I could list books that sold really well. Theyâ€™d be great in the sense of having made a great deal of money</p>

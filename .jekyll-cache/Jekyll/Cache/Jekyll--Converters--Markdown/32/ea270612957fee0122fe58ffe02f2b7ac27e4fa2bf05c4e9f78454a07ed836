I"ê<p>in every interaction, look for aliveness. this is where a personâ€™s energy come out: excitement, anger, passion. do it for both yourself and the other. bring that out. expand on it.</p>

<p>adults put a a lot of effort into controlling their energy discharges, not being too loud or moving too weirdly. aliveness is when you allow the energy to discharge naturally, the way a small child would. we learn to â€˜behaveâ€™ to avoid shame. we forget how to be comfortable in our skin.</p>

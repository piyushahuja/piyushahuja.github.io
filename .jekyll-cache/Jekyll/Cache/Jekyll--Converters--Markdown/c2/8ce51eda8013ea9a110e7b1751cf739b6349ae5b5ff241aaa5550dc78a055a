<h1 id="universals-and-properties">Universals and Properties</h1>

<p>Should the properties an object has in common with other objects, such as color and shape, be considered to exist beyond those objects? And if a property exists separately from objects, what is the nature of that existence?</p>

<p>Universals are qualities or relations found in two or more entities.[3] As an example, if all cup holders are circular in some way, circularity may be considered a universal property of cup holders.[4] Further, if two daughters can be considered female offspring of Frank, the qualities of being female, offspring, and of Frank, are universal properties of the two daughters. Many properties can be universal: being human, red, male or female, liquid or solid, big or small, etc.</p>

<p>Philosophers agree that human beings can talk and think about universals, but disagree on whether universals exist in reality beyond mere thought and speech.</p>

<h1 id="time">Time</h1>

<p>Is it absurd to suppose that only the present exists?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To say that only present exists, is that the only thing in our world is there here and now, and any talk about the past or the future is much like a fictional talk, which has its referent as something which doesn’t exist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>McTaggart’s proof about hte unreality of time: When McTaggart says ‘‘Time involves change’’, it seems like a sleight of hand. What does it mean? Time is the dimension of change. But that doesn’t make anything clearer.
We observe time through A series and B series, or we observe the dimension of change through A series and B series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does tense indicate a feature of the world? Do tensed statements have tenseless truth conditions? Would that show that tense is unreal?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can later events affect earlier events? Is Time Travel possible?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="persistence-through-time">Persistence Through Time</h1>

<p>Material objects extend through space by having different spatial parts in different places. But how do they persist through time? According to some philosophers, things have temporal parts as well as spatial parts</p>

<p>If you have different temporal parts, this would explain how you can exist at different times, and it would also explain how you can have different properties at different times (you-yesterday hasn’t heard of temporal parts, you-tomorrow is an expert)</p>

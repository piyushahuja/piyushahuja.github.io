<hr />

<p>in every conversation, look for aliveness. this is where a person’s inner child come out: excitement, anger, passion.</p>

<p>bring that out. expand on it.</p>

<p>1) relentlessly following the thread of aliveness; discovering what makes both of us light up and going there</p>

<p>2) telling the other person where they came the most alive</p>

<p>normally adults are putting a lot of effort into controlling how their energy discharges, not being too loud or moving too weirdly etc.</p>

<p>aliveness is when you allow the energy to discharge naturally, the way a small child would. we learn to ‘behave’ to avoid shame. we forget how to be comfortable in our skin. children are our teachers in so many ways.</p>

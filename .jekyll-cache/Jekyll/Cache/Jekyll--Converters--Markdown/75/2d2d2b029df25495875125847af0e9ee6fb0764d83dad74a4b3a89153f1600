    <p>The desire for seld transformation is often <strong>rooted in escapism and delusion</strong> - where one thinks that â€œIf I pursue this, I will be happyâ€, where you sacrifice the present moment for some illusory elusive future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>It is also <strong>rooted in rejection of the self</strong>, especially if one is pursuing self-transformation because they think of themselves as inadequate or not â€œgood enoughâ€. That self-assessmentplants an insecurity based on a focus on weaknesses rather than strengths, and a mentality of scarcity rather than of abundance. If left unchecked the insecurities coulld lead to comparison, envy, jealousy, and anxiety from chasing unrealistic ideals and perfectionism.

      <p>â€˜â€™He painted a very feeble picture when he spoke of himself, a practice that was humorously meant, but that bellied, nevertheless, an excessively vulnerable self-conception. For he measured all his actions by a private standard of perfection, and laboured in service of this standard; as a consequence he was never really satisfied with any of his efforts, or with their results, and tended, in general, towards defeatism.â€ - The Luminaries</p>

  <li>Self-rejection can ultimately lead to an alienation from the self. In the worst case, it <strong>can lead to building a false-self image or turning into a sociopath</strong> filled with persistent inner shame.
For example, one might want to become good at reading people, or being charismatic, or a good salesman, by learning hacks. But the hidden cost of manipulative behaviour would be the slow decline of respect for people, yourself and a distinct lack of empathy. Psychopaths like Ted Bundy are very good at reading people. Â Ultimately if you are unable to respect people, you will inevitably lose respect.

      <p>If you are really good with it it might work, but what is the damn point? We can all spot from a mile away when someone is trying to take something from us or sell us something. Even if we canâ€™t put our finger on it exactly, we sense something is up. And then we are just waiting for the confirmation moment. â€œAha! I knew it!â€</p>

    <p>If improving in one thing is incongruous with improving in another, <strong>one can lose integrity.</strong> If you mimic the mannerisms of your role models, you can end up as a bizarre pastiche of different people, including yourself.</p>
  </li>

    <p>For certain aspects of life, and arguably the only worthy ones, pursuing them as a conscious goal is the very thing that ensures that you do not reach there. These include, for example: authenticiy, â€œbeing yourselfâ€, happiness, wichanging someoneâ€™s feelings about you, spontaneity etc. <strong>Many desirable states are best pursued indirectly</strong>, and conscious thought and effortful striving can actually interfere with their attainment.Â

  <li>Lastly, is it even possible to self improve? Any personality created by you is artificial and limited.  To make a conscious choice â€œIâ€™d do this,  then Iâ€™d be thatâ€.  <strong>Whatever you little mind comes up with, will be too bare-bones, skeletal, analytical and limited. The world is expansive, abundant, changing, flowing, spontaneous.</strong> You can never capture it your little self-aware consciousness thoughts in your little minds. So <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3605242">forget self-improvement</a> Instead confront your insecurities, accept them, be yourself, and pursue some love, passion or purpose. Improvement can come indirectly.</li>

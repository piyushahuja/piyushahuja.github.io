I"‰	<p>34 this month. Itâ€™s time to take stock.</p>

<p>This juncture of life feels crucial in a way others werenâ€™t. It feels as if I am at a crucial bend in the road, and if I donâ€™t maneuver it well, I could be permanenly thrown off track, derailed, in many important areas of life: career, relationships, and family.  I am already late, but not too late, and this feels like a last chance to course correct.</p>

<p>In my mid 20s, I had created a wishlist of six goals for myself: to strengthen my body, to sharpen my wit, to hone my craft (programming), to inculcate an ability to lead, to learn life saving skills, and to write a novel.</p>

<p>To realistically assess these a decade on, I have fulfilled most of them to a reasonable degree. I got in shape enough to the extent that people would compliment me on my fitness unprompted, or object if I were to refer to myself as overweight.  The most beautiful girl in my meditation retreat referred to me as the funniest person in the group. As a product manager and later an entrepreneur, I learnt to recruit, lead product teams, and give talks at conferences. As a programmer, I became a senior software engineer.</p>

<p>Looking back, it is quite revealing that five of those six desires focussed on personal development. If I am really honest, they stemmed for a fundamental feeling of discontent with my own self - a persistent, lingering feeling that I could name but found hard to dispel.</p>

<p>By 30, I had narrowed my desires to three: to build a company, write a novel, and have my own happy family.  At 32, I bought a house. And became a landlord. At 33, I started a company. I recruited a friend and some interns. I won a competitive Â£15k grant. I won and fulfilled a Â£34k contract.</p>

<p>What do I want at 34?</p>

<p>I want a family with a life partner, children, and a comfortably big home. I want children. I want a job with smart coworkers I enjoy working with and that allows me enough income to afford childcare, to send my kids to good schools, and to meet other needs such as travel and coaching, as well as work life balance to spend time with them.</p>

<p>Second, I want my spiritual, feel-good, healthy masculine energy that I had growing up. I want to feel that feeling of gratitude again, where I would feel extraordinarily lucky, good things and people start coming in my life, I become extraordinarily productive, and I see beauty in everything.</p>

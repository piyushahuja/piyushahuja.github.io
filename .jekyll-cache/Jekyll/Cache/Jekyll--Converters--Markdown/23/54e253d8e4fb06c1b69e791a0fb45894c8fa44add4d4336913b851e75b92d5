I"»=<p>Watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vkOu2lKEaw">the clip</a> still makes me smile at how I used to be.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s the semi-finals. We have reached the last four of the NDTV Tech Grandmasters, a nationally televised quiz show which saw participation from schools, colleges and corporates all over India.  We are riding on a string of impressive victories of various kinds: narrow strategic wins, impressive comebacks or no-contest domination. Now is our time to soar and go one step further.</p>

<p>The contest is about to begin, but thereâ€™s an introductory segment, in which the host asks us:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>â€œIIT Delhi. Impressive story of success all through. Great journey till here, but the first question I have, You took out [some team] in the last one. This time a fight more of the equals, or you think you are superior? Are you flying high is the main question?â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Timid and unsmiling, I splutter:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>â€œNo weâ€™re not, actuallyâ€¦.because we are well aware of this teamâ€¦. because weâ€™ve been quizzing in the past.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then position ourselves as underdogs by sheepishly confessing that the NSIT team had beaten us on no less than six or so occasions in the past.<sup id="fnref:NSIT"><a href="#fn:NSIT" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>The virtues of the underdog mentality</strong></p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a lot that can be said about the virtues of thinking of yourself as an underdog. If you overestimate the other team, it makes you set higher standards and try harder. If your head is not up in the clouds,  youâ€™d pay more attention.  And thereâ€™s also a devious pleasure in lulling the opposition in a false sense of security before taking them down. It was the mindset that had not just landed us in the top four in that particular quiz show, but also held me in good stead in other areas of competitive life: during exam preparations, interviews, and elections. It more or less worked.</p>

<p>The underdog mentality is not just a motivator for trying harder, but was also a clever emotional management strategy. Losing no longer hurts - when you lose, things are as you had expected.  When you win, you get the pleasant surprise of victory. <sup id="fnref:ESPN"><a href="#fn:ESPN" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Dropping the expectation of winning was my insurance against the risk of heartbreak. What I didnâ€™t realise then, and I do now, is that buying that insurance  might have, at times, ensured the very outcome I had insured against.</p>

<p>In that ill-fated semifinal, we won the first two rounds and raced to a commanding 80-30 lead, only to choke in the final buzzer round and lose 80-70. And on reflection,  the reason we lost was not that the other team was better, or we had worse luck, or that we were nervous. We were not. What did us in was the lack of killer instinct. And we lacked a killing instinct because we didnâ€™â€˜t think of ourselves as winners.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Whatâ€™s wrong with the underdog mentality?</strong></p>

<p>When expect yourself to lose, you accept defeat without any consequence. You accept it because it conforms with your identity. And you lose an important motivator to avoid losing: a sense of disappointment with yourself, a kind of shame that hurts.</p>

<p>Worse, by allowing the opponent to see that you are vulnerable, you remove their anxieties and self-doubt for them.</p>

<p>A lack of winning mentality is particularly lethal in interviews. As it is the case in sports, an interviewerâ€™s job is to spot and pick winners- not dispense social justice.  And the interviewer can easily gauge who you are from what you think of yourself. Similarly, intervieweesâ€™ concern is to join winners, not a sinking ship. If you think of yourself as a sinking ship, then they would think the same of you. â€¨</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>â€œIf you a low opinion of yourself youâ€™ll attract people who agree with that low opinion.â€ â€¨â€¨</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often, thinking yourself as an underdog spills over to an instinctive belief that others know better, and their judgement is to be trusted over my own.Â  And then you allow others to believe that you are not worthy of following.  ( <sup id="fnref:interviewFail"><a href="#fn:interviewFail" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œThink youâ€™re a slave and youâ€™ll find a master; think youâ€™re a master and slaves will find youâ€</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What do winners look like?</strong></p>

<p>When I think of winners, I think of personalities like Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Roger Federer and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udi0rk3jZYM">Steve Jobs</a>. They all exude an intimidating confidence.  Their aura plants seeds of doubts in the minds of their opponents.  They seem to find a way to perform just when most needed.  It is the same with teams: think of the ability of Zidaneâ€™s Real Madrid to score goals in extra time or Fergusonâ€™s Manchester United to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.</p>

<p>But even institutions outside sports and competitive contest can reflect winning mentality:Â Oxford, Harvard, McKinsey, The New Yorker, The Economist. These institutions have all formed an image of perfectionism and excellence. One gets the impression that any task taken by members of these institutions in their respective fields would be done well.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What does the winning mindset feel like?</strong></p>

<p>â€¨â€¨A winning mindsetÂ is tied to an identity and worldview. Losing isnâ€™t just an event which is disappointing - it conflicts with who you are.Â  When you lose, you are not being yourself. Your entire worldview is at threat.  They do not care for what other people think, but care much more about what they think of themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œShow me a good loser, and Iâ€™ll show you a loserâ€.Â </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>A supreme, unwavering confidence in their abilities. There are no seeds of self-doubt ready to sprout.</li>
  <li>A laser-like focus when surrounded by distractions and a refusal to think of things outside their control. The focus conquers all anxiety, frustration, and discouragement.</li>
  <li>Ability to bring intensity to the next level at the right moments. Especially in the face of adversity (e.g. red card, missed chance, goal down), winners give everything theyâ€™ve got in order to win.  Since winners bring their A-game in every task, it is crucial to pick battles.

<p><strong>Cultivating a winning mentality</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Remember the victories and forget past defeats</strong>. If youâ€™ve never won, winning frees you. That winning the first time takes you to another level - gets rid of a major psychological barrier to winning: the seeds of doubt</p>
  </li>
  <li>In practice, pursue your mission systematically and diligently, with conviction, confidence and calm. You owe to yourself the pro-activenesspresent in Army (or Consulting), to have the attitude of an ex-army commando.Â 
    <blockquote>
      <p>Go to the gym.  Push heavy things around.  Break a sweat. Donâ€™t just half-ass it.  Push yourself until you want to die.  This is how you can get the highest ROI.  Anything less is a waste of your time.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the immediate point where youâ€™re about to perform, itâ€™s not helpful to focus on winning but about the performance you want to elicit.  Maintain aÂ clear mind, recognize yourÂ purpose, and implement yourÂ <a href="https://www.essentialtennis.com/winners-mentality-tennis-development/">system</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Observe: Assess strengths and weaknesses of opponents and exploit it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recognize when your opponent is struggling whereby you can attack and build momentum. When your opponent is beating themselves up for their play,Â this is your golden ticket to finishing off the match.â€¨</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pick your battles</strong>. And then go all-in. <a href="https://qr.ae/pNynKW">Play to win</a></li>

<p><strong>Example: Americans</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Americans are single-minded like no nationality I have ever seen. They get down straight to business. They love to win. They play to win. And they will push relentlessly 24/7 and never let up. All. the. time. In every field - business, technology, sports, you name it. And thatâ€™s an attitude after my own heart. I simply love it and wouldnâ€™t have it any other way. The wealth, friendliness, optimism, arrogance, insularity and even ignorance of Americans is all too famous and talked about. What is monumentally understated is the determination of top American professionals to pull out all stops to win. In every damn field. Donâ€™t be fooled by the friendly exterior. Yes, they are indeed a generous people and they smile a lot - but once they are in a serious contest, Son, you better have your shit straightened out, bring your A-game or theyâ€™ll clean out your clock. That affable personality conceals a steely and ruthless determination to do whatever it will take to climb to the top. You know the way some Westerners look and wonder why Americans work so hard? Yes, itâ€™s the price you pay if you want to win. And Americans at the top in each profession will pay it gladly! Iâ€™ve seen that play go down in my career everywhere from research laboratories at American universities to Wall Street investment banks. The lawyer who served as general counsel at my sisterâ€™s former employer, a large corporation in NYC - you know when that SOB came into work? 4 a.m. every morning. Youâ€™d look at his annual paycheck of over a million dollars and think he had it so good - unless you knew how incredibly dedicated and diligent the man was. And nobody sees him start his work day when itâ€™s still dark before dawn. Youâ€™re in a race to run those experiments and publish that paper?Â Â Youâ€™re vying to get that big M&amp;A deal? Thatâ€™s the kind of men who youâ€™re up against. If the opponents arenâ€™t down with it 100%, the American scientists, lawyers or investment bankers will chew them up and spit them out. Case in point - Sports. The top echelons of sport are the ultimate exemplar of determination and the ability to take stress. Now, Iâ€™m not even talking about the Olympics. Just take a look at soccer to see what I mean. Most Americans donâ€™t give a hoot about watching that sport compared to the big four (baseball, American football, basketball, ice hockey). And people constantly mock Americans for calling it â€œsoccerâ€. Yet the American soccer team has reached the round of 16 four times in the last six FIFA World Cups. Think about it - this nation whose people donâ€™t even care much for the sport, manages to have a record as good as England on the international stage, a nation that is batshit bonkers about football! And there are populous nations like Mexico who are bananas about football (but donâ€™t manage anywhere close. Even outside of the World Cup, since 2000, the US has won 13 and lost just 7 of its matches against our neighbors to the South. You can bet that each time Mexico wins, its a much bigger deal in Mexico City than it is in New York City when the U.S. team wins (in fact few even notice). Can you now even imagine what would happen if Americans got even half as crazy about football as they are about basketball or American football? The NBA slogan sums up the quintessential American attitude when it comes to competition, better than anything else.</p>

<p><strong>Example: Andy Murray</strong></p>

<p>Andy Murray found focus only after a 2008 Olympic defeat:Â </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œI was so excited to play in the Olympics and be part of it that I was doing a lot of media. I learnt a lot from that match. It was one of the toughest losses of my career, and I donâ€™t plan to repeat the experience on Wednesday. I was going to the opening ceremony, I was trying to speak to all of the athletes and take pictures with them, I was collecting the pins from each team - I was loving being part of it. â€œBut when I lost, I thought, â€˜Why was I doing all that stuff? Iâ€™m here to win matches, Iâ€™m not here to collect pins.â€™ I loved going to the opening ceremony but had to think, â€˜Is that the best thing for my preparation?â€™Â </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He got very close to winning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzCB4YQXPeM">2012 Wimbledon Final</a>, but you can see by how much it hurt him that he really wanted it.</p>

<p>But he then won the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/tennis/9454659/Andy-Murray-I-would-not-trade-my-London-2012-Olympic-gold-for-a-first-Wimbledon-title.html">Olympic 2012 Gold</a>, and that broke the barrier. He found the elusive winning mentality in the middle of the career, unlike Jana Novotna or Goran Ivanisevic - who, despite having the opportunities to win, Â struggled for years because they lacked the magical sense ofÂ â€œknowing winningâ€, and the focus and inner belief that comes with it.
Prior to winning the Olympic Gold, Murray was stuck in the same mire ofÂ uncertainty and doubt that did not leave Ivanisevic and Novotna through much of their career. But winning the Olympic gold set him free of it - it unlocked the winning mentality, and their was no going back. Winning gives you a mental grasp of your target, and once you know it,Â Â darkness and uncertainty disappears.Â </p>

<p>Contrast Murray with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenie_Bouchard">Eugenie Bouchard</a>, who after losing the 2014 Wimbledon Final, started believing that she is destined for winning even before actually doing it, and totally lost it.</p>

I"Ú<p>When I was younger, I used to read the works of great writers and feel a certain kinship to them. Reading a book, I would often go, ‚ÄúSo true! This is how I feel as well!‚Äù. Because great writers wrote about some of the same stuff I used to think about, I would tell myself that I must be wise like them.</p>

<p>Now that I am older, I realize that I felt close to them not because I was anything like them, but because they, being great writers, wrote about stuff <em>anyone</em> would relate to. That‚Äôs what had made them great in the first place. Their work was timeless and universal. I related to their writings not because I was wise, but because they were.</p>

<p>And having had this wise epiphany about my own erstwhile stupidity, I (again) tell myself that I must have <em>now</em> become wiser. No doubt, at some later point of life, I would again realize the follies of what I now consider wisdom. Maybe this is what all wisdom is: an ever-increasing appreciation of your own stupidity.</p>

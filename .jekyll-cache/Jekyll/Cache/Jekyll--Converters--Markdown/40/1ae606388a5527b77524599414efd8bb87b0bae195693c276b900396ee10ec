I"Ö<p>There is a â€œway of beâ€ in the world that is tantric.</p>

<p>It is non-reactive and relaxed.
It feels effortless, free, in the â€œflow of lifeâ€, genuine, authentic, â€œin integrityâ€.
All emotions are welcome, including: fear, anger, sadness (to investigate: what about â€œstressâ€, â€œanxietyâ€, â€œnervousnessâ€, â€œjealousyâ€). 
It has heightened awareness of your own emotions, your senses. 
You see reality â€œas isâ€, including the emotions of others. 
You have needs, but you are not â€œneedyâ€. You are not in a â€œgettingâ€ state. 
You give freeily, but do not â€œgive to getâ€.
You are able to play and take risks.</p>

<p>Often I criticize myself for not being socially savvy, for not being able to make small talk or have conversations with beautiful women. But the reason I feel uncomfortable to talk to certain woman have nothing to do with ability, but often about the cues that I have subconsciously picked up on how the other personâ€™s attitutde towards me.</p>

<p>Example: After the men-women reunion, I felt comfortable talking to Sarah, Kathy, Vanese, Stella, but not with Ingrid, Katie, etc. This was entirely due on them, and nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>It might be good to bring these cues to awareness, so that I communicate.</p>

<hr />

<p>Erring on the side of asking for permission always works: â€œWould you be comfortable texting?â€ rather than assuming one way or the other. If i assume too much, I might signal i am not good at boundaries, or am intrusive. If I assume too less, I might miss out on connection where possibility of connection exists.</p>

<ul>
  <li>May I hold your hand?</li>
  <li>Would you be comfortable talking about sexual matters?</li>
  <li>Would you be open to texting?</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I have trauma informed patterns</strong></p>

<p>Truth is, I was in a very different state of mind (and feeling) when I started this journey than I am now. It is impossible to recall how I my internal experience of myself used to be, but I remember the facts clearly:</p>

<p>I broke down in tears after Vaneseâ€™s initiation in LT1. Slowly at first, then violently when I realized that my beloved wouldnt not only look at me, but wouldnt even care for me. It felt pretty natural then, and was cathartic, but it was, in hindsight, what they call a â€œtrauma response.â€ It triggered all those memories of not being loved, not being cared for, and importantly, of â€œbeing abandonedâ€. I had thoughts of â€œThis, Again, Ofcourseâ€, â€œWould anyone ever love me?â€, â€œI have to live with this pattern foreverâ€.</p>

<p>I also got incredibly melancholic after the Men-Women reunion after LT1 in Florence House, after observing my beloved. Slowly at first, then back at the mattress. Mellower than the first, but this was also a â€œtrauma responseâ€ that reminded me of all previous instances of false hope.</p>

<p>At the end of LT1, I spoke to Sarah about â€œI am not someone on the marginâ€. It was comletely informed by how I imagined she saw me, rather than how I was feeling.</p>

<p>I â€œgot backâ€ at Rich after my initiation in LT2. At the time, I felt in my power and proud of myself. And though difficult to see, this was also â€œa trauma responseâ€. Was it? Although the response was informed by fear of â€œbeing bulliedâ€. it was authentic and in tune with how I was feeling. It was also controlled. What it did lack was a mindful awareness of my feeling. And it definitely lacked awareness of all the other ways I could have responded, or channeled my energy. It was reactive, it lacked mindful choice.</p>

<p>Would I have the same reaction if the same series of events were to happen to me now?</p>

<p>Possibly not. I have received loved by the one I so desired love from in my LT1, I was chosen by the one I desired in Florence House LT1, and I have received love from Jo. I am lovable, I can be loved, I have been loved, I am loved and I will be loved.</p>

<p>Do I still have trauma informed pattenrs?</p>

<p>One is the â€œfear of being taken for grantedâ€</p>

<p><strong>Wheel of Consent</strong></p>

<p>An insight: an energetic transaction or exchange is not just about â€œgiveâ€
 and â€œtakeâ€, i.e. it is not single dimensional. One can â€œtakeâ€ by giving, and â€œgiveâ€ by takingâ€. It is two dimensional.</p>

<p>How does one give by taking? By taking from others for their own needs. By â€œallowingâ€ others to give. When I allow my parents to give me advice that I do not need, I make them feel valued. I â€œgive energyâ€ by â€œtakingâ€ advice.</p>

<p>How does one take by giving?  When I â€œgive somethingâ€ to meet my own needs (of self-esteem, or feeling good about myself e.g.). Rescuing to feel good about myself would fall toin this category. For example, me giving an orgasm to D.</p>

<p>Okay, so those are the counter-intutive ones.</p>

<p>How does one â€œgiveâ€ by â€œgivingâ€ then? When I give something to others, â€œfor othersâ€. For example, me giving an orgasm to J.</p>

<p>It is useful to be aware of</p>

<hr />

<p>Why do I feel upset when Richa does not show gratitude?  (She des not appreciate my giving). Because I am giving for her, and she does not recognize it. Maybe I am giving for myself? Is being upset at the giving being received an indication that it is for myself?
I was amused when Clara reciprocated my energy. She gave back to my giving, I imagine for a sense of equality and â€œnot owingâ€. I was partly giving for myself.
Why am I upset when someone doesnt respond to a compliment?</p>

I".<p>My culinary adventures in Singapore refuse to end. The other day I, rather daringly, tried a dish named The Steamboat, from the Greatwall Chinese restaurant. In the semantic map of my brain, steamboat resides right next to submarine, which meant that my anticipation of the dish was overladen with the connotations usually attached to a submarine sandwich. So one can imagine my amusement when I was handed a huge two-layered pot, the lower level of which was filled with a greyish powder. I was in the process of resolving my dilemma as to whether I should eat this strange-looking stuff with a fork, mix it with curry, put it in the soup, or eat it with rice when, to my utter shock, the restaurant-lady set it on fire. It was also the moment it dawned upon me that however harmless these adventures might seem as compared to, say sky-diving, one ought to be more careful. Uptil then I had been living a very contented, complacent life â€“ just indulging in the local culture, immersing myself in the local language, soaking up the culinary traditions developed in this melting pot of a nation, and keeping away from the usual life-threatening adventures a typical traveler, in want of a thrill, subjects himself to. (Read Scuba-diving, Skydiving in SE Asia). The food I eat fills up the thrill-quota for me alright.</p>

I"J<p>They love me…they love me not.</p>

<p>I feel by now I have a pretty good handle on the question. I don’t have to pick the petals of a poor flower: my body could tell.</p>

<p>“You sort of know…don’t you” said my friend Dawne. It was the sort of idea that has my critical thinking mind wouldn’t like to believe, but it wafted through my skeptical mind and struck a chord with the same area where the knowingness resided: my gut.</p>

<p>This is my attempt to reflect on the times I’ve been wrong, if I ever have been, and how to tell one from the other.</p>

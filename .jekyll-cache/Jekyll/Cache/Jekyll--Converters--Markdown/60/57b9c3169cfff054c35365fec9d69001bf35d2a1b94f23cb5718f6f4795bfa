<hr />

<p><strong>Response to the code test. Architectural decisions made</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Scope for improvement: do parallel async queries when loading maps as they are independent</li>
  <li>Modular: The function which parses each line, sent to processor can be  changed, though if something other than map has to be returned we would need to change processFile a bit.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>The map/reduce via Hadoop involves a lot of boilerplate, so you could take us through that as well.</strong></p>

<p>MapReduce has special datatypes for serialization, because data needs to travel across the network from the Mapper node to the Reducer node ( converting object data into byte stream data for transmission over a network across different nodes in a cluster or for persistent data storage.)</p>

<p>Hadoop data types used in Mapreduce for key or value fields must satisfy two constraints.</p>

<p>LongWritable: Default is TextInputFormat which gives byte offset of the line as the key, as in your case. byte offset of the key</p>

<p>Reporter: reports job progress for mappers and reporters. Important for the orchestraton framework handling it, as it might otherwise assume time out and kill a job.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any data type used for a Value field in mapper or reducer input/output must implement Writable Interface.</li>
  <li>Any data type used for a Key field in mapper or reducer input/output must implement WritableComparable interface along with Writable interface to compare the keys of this type with each other for sorting purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is Map Reduce?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Within a computer program, it is a design pattern for implementing functions that operate on sequences of elements, which uses the powerful idea of treating functions as first-class values that we can pass around and manipulate in our programs.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a distributed system context, it is a programming model for executing batch jobs with parallel, distributed, algorithm on a cluster (e.g. processing and generating big data sets)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an open source implementation (e.g. Hadoop), it is a system that orchestrates the processing of data by marshalling the distributed servers, running the various tasks in parallel, managing all communications and data transfers between the various parts of the system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of this model is beneficial only when the optimized distributed shuffle operation (which reduces network communication cost) and fault tolerance features of the MapReduce framework come into play. Optimizing the communication cost is essential to a good MapReduce algorithm. The scalability and fault-tolerance achieved for a variety of applications by optimizing the execution engine.</p>

<p><strong>The work they do Welcome Sanger?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Absorb and extend our use of an on-prem cloud:the code is terraform / ansible. The use is quite focused (standing up &amp; tearing down spark clusters) but as none of us are devops people, we need someone to shoulder that responsibility. 
Quota-management and budget-management tasks which need a mix of front-end and back-end work (the front-end is mainly for people like me, who cannot stay on top of the administration).</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>What specifically about working at Sanger interests you?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>It‚Äôs a great opportunity to learn latest cloud cloud tech at one of the best resourced places that utilized. Hoping to learn some biology as well! It‚Äôs not just legacy software: Ansible! Terraform! Docker!</li>
  <li>Being around smart people, campus like environment</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My experience?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Experience with relational and non-relational databases</li>
  <li>Data Storage and Delivery pipelines in Opera 6 years ago.</li>
  <li>JSON based REST APIs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How you‚Äôd like to develop?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Cloud technologies (e.g. Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, GitHub CI)</li>
  <li>Oppoturtunities to learning functional languages (Haskell/Erlang) and frotend frameworks like React.</li>

      <li>Docker,  Unix/Shell Scripting, Ansible/Terraform, Apache Spark</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What‚Äôs the best part of your job?
    <ul>
      <li>Prompts the interviewer to talk about him/herself, esp. one‚Äôs successes. Suggests interest in career at the company/industry &amp; how the firm works on the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù level. Seeds opportunity to compliment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>How to do Mock Interviews?</strong></p>

<p>Write down a list of things that your interviewers should observe you on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do you explain yourself concisely and clearly?</li>
  <li>Do you talk to everyone in turn or do you speak only to the person asking?</li>
  <li>Do you project confidence with your voice and mannerism?</li>
  <li>Do you sound rushed?</li>
  <li>Do you exude enthusiasm?</li>
  <li>How do you handle pressure questions?</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically, the interviewer is trying to answer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do I want to be on a team with this person? Can I rely on them and their work?</li>
  <li>Do I want to be stuck on an airplane with this person? Are they interesting?</li>
  <li>Could I put this person in front of a client? Is this person humble, kind, confident?</li>
  <li>Can I throw massive amounts of data and information at this person? Are they organized in their thinking to synthesize what‚Äôs most important?‚Äô</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Research the company to discover specific traits they look for in staff.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are intended to measure whether you fit with McKinsey culture (or what your interviewer thinks the culture is). That culture is compassionate, humble, curious, creative, intelligent, eager and confident. It honors leadership, integrity and hard work.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google values an open culture, interactions between teams, and focuses on providing the best user experience. In an interview for this role, include experiences from your past that demonstrate you align with all of these traits.
Do a quick  brainstorm on what you think a successful Google employee looks like, and tailor your responses to align with this mentality. Get inside the interviewer‚Äôs head (not your own).</p>

<p><strong>Prepare Stories</strong></p>

<p>Narrative Structure:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Situation</strong>: Background of the situation, setting the scene for the interviewer.  Time, setting, position, organization, characters. Conflict, what was it and what caused it.</li>
  <li><strong>Task</strong>: The specifics of what you were required to do/achieve, when, where, and who. Obstacles  Overcoming lack of resources be they time, money,  innate talent, or people magnifies your accomplishment many fold. Since  we rarely have enough of everything for plans to go smoothly, make sure  you tell the story of the difficulties you faced. what did you realize or have to change about yourself</li>
  <li><strong>Action</strong>: The steps you actually took, behaviours, characteristics and skills you used.HOW did I do this, explain it in detail. WHY you took certain actions. Did you use a process? What process? How did you get the information to make the decision? How did you bring your team on board with your line of sight? Your accomplishment could be a purely individual and personal one.  And that dish would satisfy, but for most fields, an accomplishment  involving others where you influence, motivate, persuade, cajole, and lead will turn your bread and butter into a delectable delicacy. ‚Äúwhat was your initial response?‚Äù ‚Äúhow did you overcome those biases?‚Äù)</li>
  <li><strong>Result</strong>: Final outcome. What happened, and what you learnt. how did people react, think, fell? Other outcomes?  What happened? How did your customers react? Impact. Your accomplishment must show you as a contributor who has had a significant  impact on a person, organization, or entity. Your accomplishment could be that you increased membership, led a team to victory, built a  coalition in student government that did something fantastic, increased  sales, cut costs, or found a solution to a problem that enabled a  critical deal to go forward.</li>
  <li>(Optional) <strong>Application</strong>. Demonstrate you have grown by using these learnings in a new situation. ‚Äúhow could you have approached the situation differently?‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>Some tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Answer the question appropriately. For failure, don‚Äôt talk about a poor grade or not getting a job. I told a story about how I blasted someone (much higher up), she found out and I had to apologize AND get her to trust me again.</li>
  <li>Present your talents and strengths honestly, don‚Äôt embellish negatively or positively. It‚Äôs not time to be a sales person nor too modest.</li>
  <li>Draw out the human element; did you understand others? Did you have empathy? Were you compassionate?</li>
  <li>What do you want them to <em>know</em>? What do you want them to <em>feel</em>? What do you want them to <em>do</em>?</li>
  <li>Describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previously employers vis-a-vis increasing revenues or reducing costs.  If you have not had the opportunity to do this yet, describe things which suggest you have the ability to increase revenue or reduce costs, or ideas to do so.</li>

  <li>Hurricane Sandy
    <ul>
      <li>The most challenging work I faced was in my first job. I was fresh out of college, and I was tasked with finding the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the US bond market. This was a non-trivial task, requiring both creativity, some hypothesis-making, AS well as technical skills to clean, analyse and train models on large swaths of data. Since I was fresh out of college, I had little experience of the ambiguity and practical challenges of working on a real project. This gave me a first taste of it, I learnt a lot, and by the end of it, I was able to produce a report which was quite respectable. It as even published.</li>

    <p>Sometimes delaying the decision helps: when the time allows more of relevant information to come in. But often we only delay out of fear, confusion, laziness or anxiety.

If you feel like delaying, you must introspect and be clear about Why you are delaying.</p>

<p><strong>Cover Letter</strong></p>

<p>Dear Team,</p>

<p>I am an Oxford and IIT Delhi grad, interested in software engineering roles at your company, as mentioned in your <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/.">hacker news post</a></p>

<p>Since last year, I‚Äôve been the tech lead of a startup I founded.  Our backend is based on JSON-based RESTful APIs, and utilizes the following stack:  Express, Node.js, Mongodb, AWS. From a previous job at Opera Solutions (which was my first job out of college), I have experience of working on data delivery and storage pipelines for a big data analytics. I am proficient in Java, Javascript frameworks (Node.js, Mocha, Chai, Sinon), RESTful API design, data modelling, using version controls systems like Git, and implementing authentificiaton frameworks (including Oauth and Oauth 2.0)</p>

<p>In between those two stints, I have been product manager of a consumer-facing on-demand services app used by about 3 million users across 28 cities in India. As a product manager, I led a team of 15, made product roadmaps, conducted user research and wrote detailed user journeys for the developers to implement. Before that, I read PPE at Oxford. Both these experiences instilled in me good interpersonal and communication skills which I have found to be very valuable in my career.</p>

<p>I am currently based in India, seeking new opportunities, and looking to relocate.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Graduated from IIT Delhi with a five-year integrated masters (bachelors + masters) in computer science  in 2013</li>
  <li>Worked at a big data analytics company as an an analytics specialist (13-14)</li>
  <li>Graduated from Oxford in PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics) as a second undergrad degree in 2016 Worked as a product manager in a consumer-facing tech startup (16-17)</li>
  <li>Founded a startup and led a team of four to ship the flagship product, currently live on Google Playstore  (2017- present)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please find attached my CV.  I also maintain a professional website, where you could find more details about my background: http://piyushahuja.github.io.</p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>

<p>Regards, <br />
Piyush</p>

<p><strong>My Intro/Tell me about yourself/Why I am the perfect fit for this specific opportunity? (Suggest, not tell)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>My first degree was in <strong>Computer Science</strong>  <strong>After that, I went to Oxford</strong> for a two years degree in humanities. PPE. I was one of the few places where you could get that in two years, and it is also one of the best, I went there to read for a second undergrad degree
    <ul>
      <li><strong>‚ÄúThe ability to quickly pick stuff up or learn new things‚Äù</strong>. For example, reading under the rigors of the tutorial system at Oxford has helped me develop time management skills and an ability to get work done under pressure. In software there are always new frameworks coming up, or you have to understand the API documentation quickly and quickly integrate it.</li>
      <li>A diverse background in also gives me ability to approach a problem from different perspectives and assimilate knowledge from different fields.</li>

  </li>
  <li><strong>My first job out of Oxford was in a  startup in the on-demand sector</strong> as a product manager, Jugnoo.  It was <strong>consumer facing app</strong> used by about <strong>3 million consumers across 28 cities</strong> in India.
    <ul>
      <li>One thing I got out of that role was a  complete obsession with user experience and <strong>experience handling large-scale, high-volume services.</strong>- Having seen both sides, I have a focus on customer experience</li>
      <li>I can come up with clever ways to improve usage including behavioural economics and design improvements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Since last year, I‚Äôve been working on a product called Platonia. Apart from mentoring junior team members, I‚Äôve been <strong>pretty hands-on with the server side development of the stack of the stack in Node.js</strong>  It is currently live on Google Playstore.

<p><strong>Why should we select you?</strong> (Tell, not suggest)</p>

<ul>
  <li>To put it simply, I get work done.
    <ul>
      <li>I have worked in any environment where this ability was</li>
      <li>At Jugnoo, we had weekly sprints, my team delivered one impactful feature every week.</li>
      <li>At Oxford, I had two submit two essays week-in-week out.</li>
      <li>I believe in writing software which is easy to read, test,  maintain or extend. But I also understand well trade-offs between perfection and time. Often you have to just delivery. Often its not about your code being perfect, but about iterative fast on product features.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I can see both perspectives: product managers and developers, I have a focus on customer experience</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>What are your strengths?</strong></p>

<p>Strengths</p>

<ul>
  <li>I get work done</li>
  <li>I am good at thinking in abstract terms - mathematics and philosophy.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>What motivates you?</strong> <strong>What are you passionate about?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I am passionate about learning new things.
    <ul>
      <li>This is what drove me to major in major in both and engineering. I did PPE at Oxford and CS in IIT Delhi, and this is what drove me to software engineering. There is so much to learn! I feel the experience of learning something fresh is what keeps you alive and kicking. Otherwise the world is a little boring.</li>

  </li>
  <li>Simplifying complex things</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Passion for tech and metacognition about coding well</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I am proficient in Java - which is strongly typed, object oriented, class-based. Transferring that knowleedge to <X>  would be trivial.
</X>    <ul>
      <li>I prefer statically typed and compiled languages (rather than interpreted ones). They tell me about errors in my code before I run any tests altogether, and once you get used to the boilerplate, you stop even noticing it. It is like dental hygiene, except for code.</li>

  <li>Since last year, I‚Äôve been the tech lead of Platonia, a startup I founded.</li>
  <li>Apart from mentoring junior team members, I‚Äôve been <strong>pretty hands-on with the server side development of the stack of the stack in Node.js</strong></li>
  <li>It is currently live on Google Playstore.  Our team of four shipped the product in six months. I designed, implemented, tested and monitor new functionalities to the platform.</li>
  <li>The product didn‚Äôt take off with the growth rate needed to justify further time and investment. *</li>

<p>How do you work in teams?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collaborate across teams and time zones to make things happen, review code and be open to feedback</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Briefly, what do you like &amp; dislike about your current or latest role?</strong></p>

<p>What I liked best about my latest role was that it gave me a lot of autonomy, which made me both disciplined and empowered at the same time!</p>

<p><strong>Experience making system architecture decisions (which stack to use, choice of storage enginers, whether to use microservices)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Situation:</strong> During the shipping of Platonia, we made quite a few architectural choices</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Choose a database for the application. SQL based like PostGreSQL (Relational) vs Mongo (NoSql) or Graph(Neo4J)</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Made a list of properties we needed from our database</li>
  <li>Increase speed of writing code and deploying. Presence of an online community and f libraries we can take off-the-shel and wire together  (Ruled out Graph databases)
    <ul>
      <li>Something well known: Ease of hiring developers (Ruled out Graph databases)</li>

Leaving Jugnoo for entrepreneurship</p>

<p>Sometimes delaying the decision helps: when the time allows more of relevant information to come in. But often we only delay out of fear, confusion, laziness or anxiety. In these cases, there might be a cost of delay, and delaying wouldn‚Äôt allay all those emotions or clear the confusion, but only worsen them.

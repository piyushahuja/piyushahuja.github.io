<p><strong>Professional</strong></p>

<!-- Between 2019 - 2023, I was a senior software developer at Wellcome Sanger Institute.
 -->
<p>In 2022, I was endorsed by Tech Nation as an exceptional leader in digital technology.</p>

<p>As a senior software engineer, I’ve made significant contributions in devops and software development (full stack) for scientists and researchers in genomics. As a product manager, I have experience leading teams of software developers, designs, QA and marketing to launch digital products at scale.</p>

<p><strong>Education</strong></p>

<p>I read for a second BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford.  I was supported by the KC Mahindra Scholarship, <a href="https://www.tiarafoundation.com/copy-of-tiara-special-grant">Tiara Special Grant</a>, and a second undergraduate degree scholarship by Harris Manchester College. <a href="/philosophy">These are some essays</a> I wrote in my time at Oxford.</p>

<p>Before Oxford, I graduated from IIT Delhi with a five-year Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Computing in 2013. My master’s thesis was in the design of approximation algorithms for networks under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen_Garg">Naveen Garg</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/research">The research page</a> has a summary of my research.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Hobbies</strong></p>

<p>I used to be a competitive quizzer. I had my 15 minutes on fame when I appeared on some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5pdjrdj0uA">nationally televised quiz shows</a> in my college days.</p>

<!-- My [master's thesis]([link to my thesis][thesis]) was in the design of approximation algorithms for networks under [Naveen Garg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen_Garg).  -->

<!-- The [work section](/work)  spells out my professional experience in greater detail.

<!-- 
 One of the best way to learn is to teach it to someone. Platonia allows one to organize one-on-one meetups with people for learning-and-teaching. Give it a try! Here's the [download link for iOS]((http://itunes.com/apps/platonia)) and here's the [download link for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.platonia_client). -->

<!-- - **Teaching:**  I am interested in teaching or mentoring opportunies in philosophy, algorithms, and creative writing.

- **Learning:** I am looking for people interested in practicing Improv, First Aid, or Wilderness survival skills.  

- **Creative Collaborations:** If you'd like to collaborate on something for *fun*, please don't hesitate to reach out. Here are some ideas: a podcast, a comedy sketch, a mobile app, or any long-form writing assignment.

<p>Allegory</p>

<p>China Mieville on Allegory
“… I dislike thinking in terms of allegory—quite a lot. … The reason for that is partly something that Frederic Jameson has written about, which is the notion of having a master code that you can apply to a text and which, in some way, solves that text. At least in my mind, allegory implies a specifically correct reading—a kind of one-to-one reduction of the text.</p>

<p>It amazes me the extent to which this is still a model by which these things are talked about, particularly when it comes to poetry. This is not an original formulation, I know, but one still hears people talking about ‘what does the text mean?’—and I don’t think text means like that. Texts do things.</p>

<p>I’m always much happier talking in terms of metaphor, because it seems that metaphor is intrinsically more unstable. A metaphor fractures and kicks off more metaphors, which kick off more metaphors, and so on. In any fiction or art at all, but particularly in fantastic or imaginative work, there will inevitably be ramifications, amplifications, resonances, ideas, and riffs that throw out these other ideas. These may well be deliberate; you may well be deliberately trying to think about issues of crime and punishment, for example, or borders, or memory, or whatever it might be. Sometimes they won’t be deliberate.</p>

<p>But the point is, those riffs don’t reduce. There can be perfectly legitimate political readings and perfectly legitimate metaphoric resonances, but that doesn’t end the thing. That doesn’t foreclose it. The text is not in control. Certainly the writer is not in control of what the text can do—but neither, really, is the text itself.</p>

<p>So I’m very unhappy about the idea of allegoric reading, on the whole. Certainly I never intend my own stuff to be allegorical. … When ‘Iron Council’ came out, people would say to me: ‘Is this book about the Gulf War? Is this book about the Iraq War? You’re making a point about the Iraq War, aren’t you?’ And I was always very surprised. I was like, listen: if I want to make a point about the Iraq War, I’ll just say what I think about the Iraq War. …</p>

<p>But insisting on that does not mean for a second that I’m saying—in some kind of unconvincing, ‘cor-blimey, I’m just a story-teller, guvnor,’ type-thing—that these books don’t riff off reality and don’t have things to say about it.</p>

<p>There’s this very strange notion that a writer needs to smuggle these other ideas into the text, but I simply don’t understand why anyone would think that that’s what fiction is for.”</p>

<p>What are some literary techniques used by writers to make seemingly silly ideas sound credible?
This question previously had details. They are now in a comment.

There are three methods I can think of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Be up front: “As absurd as it may seem…”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build your way slowly and meticulously towards the absurdity. Figure out a plausible (but unlikely) way the absurd thing could have happened, and, step by step, describe the causal chain, leading the reader to feel that, in the end, the absurdity is inevitable. (This is the strategy used in the film “The Hangover.”)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simply and boldly claim the absurdity is true and then delve deeply into it, exploring all of its details. This is the strategy used in many fantasy stories. In “Game of Thrones,” seasons last for years (e.g. Winter might last for ten years.) There’s no explanation for this (though maybe one will come eventually). It’s just posited. But the fun comes when the author explores all the ramifications of this.</p>

<p>What would reasoning look like if we model the world as a dynamic entity where many possible worlds are possible, where events unfold, and as we observe what happens alternative realities are destroyed?  What laws of thought would govern reasoning about uncertainty and information?</p>

<p>Logic is absolute. The real world is messy. When faced with uncertainty, instead of abandoning logic, we extend it through probability.  Probability is the study of correct reasoning under uncertainty.</p>

<p>If logic deals in truth values: 0 or 1, probability deals in degrees of plausibility: [0,1]. Instead of propositions, we study events and evidence.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<p>P(A) = 1 =&gt; I know A is true.</p>

<p>P(A) = 0 =&gt; I know A is false.</p>

<p>Intermediate values =&gt; “I don’t know; A is more or less plausible.”</p>

<p>Probabilities are thus generalized truth values.<sup id="fnref:cox" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cox" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In logic, inference is deductive: If A implies B, and A is true, then B must be true.</p>

<p>In probability, Bayesian inference is inductive: If A supports B with likelihood, and A is plausible, then B’s plausibility updates by Bayes’ rule.</p>

<p>A probabilistic model $p_\theta(x)$ encodes your beliefs about how likely different observations $x$ are, given parameters $\theta$. When you observe a new data point $x$, you want to update those beliefs. The rule for inference here is called Bayes’ rule:</p>

\[p(\theta \mid x) \propto p(x \mid \theta)\,p(\theta)\]

<hr />

<p>There are certain dynamics that play out when we model the world as events with uncertainty and reason about it:</p>

<p><strong>For independent events, likelihoods are multiplicative.</strong> If one event is risky, and the other is risky, the risk of both occuring is muliplicative. When evidence accumulates, it’s through conjunction: Data point 1 and Data point 2 and Data point 3. The likelihood of all those observations is the product of their individual likelihoods (under independence).</p>

<p>Consider several examples of multiplicative probability in independent events:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Flipping 10 coins:</strong><br />
The probability of obtaining one specific sequence of heads and tails is<br />
\(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{10}\) since each coin flip is independent with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ for each outcome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Observing 100 i.i.d. data points:</strong><br />
The likelihood of observing a particular sequence is the product of the individual probabilities:
\(p(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{100}) = \prod_{i=1}^{100} p(x_i)\)
provided the $x_i$ are independent and identically distributed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Joint risk of independent failures:</strong><br />
Suppose a machine has a $\frac{1}{10}$ chance of failure each year.<br />
If you run two machines independently in parallel, the probability that both fail is:
\(\frac{1}{10} \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{100}\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>False positives in independent tests:</strong><br />
If the chance a suspect is guilty purely by random chance is $\frac{1}{100}$,<br />
and each of two independent tests has a $\frac{1}{10}$ false-positive rate,<br />
then the chance both tests indicate “guilty” by random chance is:
\(\frac{1}{10} \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{100}\)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- Joint occurrence of facts is modelled by intersection. It is the natural operation for “compounding reality”.   




The uncertainty of world-states is what ties possible worlds to probability.  

Possible Worlds: Each independent degree of freedom multiplies the number of possible worlds. With nnn binary independent factors, you don’t get n+1n+1n+1 outcomes — you get 2n2^n2n. What compounds is the size of the state space of reality. 

Each new fact or discovered outcome slices away possible worlds. Learning both A and B means we’re narrowing further, i.e. moving into a smaller intersection.  -->

<p>When you want to combine many uncertainties (as in predicting outcomes across multiple steps), multiplying tiny probabilities quickly becomes intractable.  Humans and our tools reason better in linear terms: sums, averages, margins.
Converting probability to their logarithm turns products into sums: this is numerically stable and easier to differentiate.</p>

<hr />

<p>Once an uncertain event in the world is resolved, we get some information.</p>

<p><strong>How much do we measure information? How should information from an observation behave when we reason about uncertainty?</strong></p>

<p>Common events (like the sun rising) barely update your beliefs; rare events (like a desert flood) force you to rewrite your model entirely. Thus, the rarity of an event must set its information content.</p>

<p>Before Claude Shannon, people used to think of information in terms of semantics, i.e. a message’s meaning.  But Shannon’s  insight was to anchor information to how surprising an event is i.e. “how unlikely is the world we observe, given our expectations?”</p>

<p>Shannon reasoned that any measure of information must have these two properties:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It should be a monotonic decreasing function of probability.</li>
  <li>Information should add up for independent events.</li>
</ol>

<p>To see this. suppose you want to know the outcome of two independent experiments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flip a fair coin $\left(P = \frac{1}{2}\right)$</li>
  <li>Roll a fair die $\left(P = \frac{1}{6}\right)$</li>
</ul>

<p>To identify both outcomes, you’d need the same number of yes/no questions as asking them separately, then adding the answers.</p>

<p>It can be proven function that satisfies both properties is the logarithm:</p>

\[I(x) = -\log P(x)\]

<p>$-\log P(x)$ is the unique measure of information.<sup id="fnref:bits" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bits" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:addition" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:addition" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<!-- 
It ties prediction and control together Prediction: information tells you how much uncertainty was reduced by seeing the actual outcome. Control: information tells you how much “room to maneuver” you gain when you know what actually happened.

Imagine a telegraph operator sending symbols (dots/dashes, or letters). Some symbols occur more often than others (“E” more than “Z”). To send messages efficiently, we’d like frequent symbols to use shorter codes, rare symbols to use longer codes (like Morse code).


It’s operational If you want to transmit outcomes over a noisy channel, you need enough symbols to cover the worst-case surprise. That leads directly to coding theorems and compression limits. -->
<!-- 
Logic says: “If X is true, then Y must follow.” Probability says: “Given X, Y becomes more plausible.” Information says: “How much more plausible did Y get after we actually observed X?” -->

<hr />
<p><strong>Can we learn from information?</strong></p>

<p>Say a probabilistic model $p_\theta(x)$ encodes your beliefs about how likely different observations $x$ are, given parameters $\theta$.</p>

<p>Each observation has a surprise:</p>

\[\text{surprise}(x) = -\log p_\theta(x)\]

<p>The gradient of this surprise with respect to $\theta$:</p>

\[\nabla_\theta \left( -\log p_\theta(x) \right ) = -\nabla_\theta \log p_\theta(x)\]

<p>tells you how to adjust your model to make the observed event less surprising next time.</p>

<p>Imagine every possible probability distribution $p_\theta(x)$ as a point on a smooth surface: a statistical manifold. Here, $\theta = (\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_n)$ are the parameters (like mean and variance for a Gaussian). Changing $\theta$ moves you to a nearby distribution. So, instead of Euclidean space with coordinates $x, y, z$, you have a space of probability models with coordinates $\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_n$.</p>

<p>The gradient of $\log p_\theta(x) = \nabla_\theta \log p_\theta(x)$, also called the “score function”, is a vector in parameter space that gives the direction of steepest information gain and tells you how fast the log-likelihood changes per unit change in parameter.</p>

<p>“If the world looked like $x$, how should my beliefs about $\theta$ move?”</p>

<p>To update a probabilistic model from data, we must change parameters in the direction that reduces the surprise of observed outcomes.</p>

<p>This is equivalent to an infinitesimal form of Bayesian reasoning.  Recall that Bayes’ rule of inference tells you how to update a full probability distribution after seeing data:</p>

\[p(\theta \mid x) = \frac{p(x \mid \theta)\; p(\theta)}{p(x)}\]

<p>Bayesian updating says:</p>

\[\log p(\theta \mid x) = \log p(\theta) + \log p(x \mid \theta) - \log p(x)\]

<p>Taking the gradient with respect to $\theta$:</p>

\[\nabla_\theta \log p(\theta \mid x) = \nabla_\theta \log p(\theta) + \nabla_\theta \log p(x \mid \theta)\]

<p>That’s the Bayesian gradient update:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A likelihood term that pulls toward data ($\nabla_\theta \log p(x \mid \theta)$).  This is the same as the score function.</li>
  <li>A prior term that regularizes beliefs ($\nabla_\theta \log p(\theta)$)</li>
</ul>

<p>The posterior update direction (how beliefs about 
$\theta$ should move) is given by the score function plus the gradient of the prior. If we assume a flat or uniform prior 
\(\nabla_\theta \log p(\theta) = 0\)
then the only term left is the score function.</p>

<p>So to reduce surprise, we go in the same direction as we would go if we assumed that our</p>

<p>distribution  and did a Bayesian update on our .  Gradient ascent on log-likelihood (or descent on negative log likelihood) can be viewed as a Bayesian update in the limit of infinitesimal data and flat priors, or where the posterior distribution is a point estimate. <sup id="fnref:prior" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:prior" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<!-- 
The Hessian of $\log p_\theta(x)$ defines the curvature: i.e., how fast uncertainty changes as you move in parameter space. That curvature is the geometry of information. 

For any differentiable probability distribution $p_\theta(x)$:
$$
\nabla_\theta p_\theta(x) = p_\theta(x)\ \nabla_\theta \log p_\theta(x)
$$

Entropy: Shannon averaged surprise across the whole distribution, defining entropy as expected information. That’s the measure of uncertainty before observation. -->

<p><strong>Learning as belief revision to reduce surprise</strong></p>

<p>Learning from experience is about reducing surprise about what works.</p>

<p>The beliefs are encoded in parameters $\theta$. The data are observations from the world. The loss is information $(−log P)$. The gradient tells us how beliefs should move to make the world less surprising.</p>

<p>This is the architecture of learning: the world generates events, those events surprise us by amounts determined by our current beliefs, and the gradient tells us exactly how to revise those beliefs to be less surprised next time.</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cross Entropy Loss</strong></p>

<p>Cross-entropy loss: the standard loss for almost all modern neural networks (softmax classifiers, transformers) measures the average surprise of the model about true outcomes. For example, in classification, we minimize the negative log likelihood of the correct class (cross entropy loss):</p>

\[L = -\log p_\theta(y_{\text{true}} \mid x)\]

<p>Suppose a classifier predicts 90% cat, 10% dog, and the true label is “dog.” The model’s surprise is −log(0.1) ≈ 2.3 bits. If it had said 60–40, surprise drops to −log(0.4) ≈ 0.9 bits.</p>

<p><strong>LLM</strong></p>

<p>An LLM (say GPT) is trained to maximize next-token likelihood (or minimize negative log likelihood):</p>

\[\min_\theta  \sum_t - \log p_\theta(x_t \mid x_{&lt;t})\]

<p>From information theory, the training loss is the cross-entropy between the data distribution $p^*(x)$ and the model $p_\theta(x)$:</p>

\[L = -\mathbb{E}_{p^*} \left[ \log p_\theta(x) \right]\]

<p>Minimizing this is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence:
\(\mathrm{KL}\left(p^* \;\|\; p_\theta\right)\)</p>

<p>When GPT predicts the next token after “The sky is”, it assigns probabilities to “blue”, “falling”, “limit”, etc. If the training data says “blue”, and GPT had only given that a 20% chance, it feels 2.3 bits of surprise (−log 0.2). Training nudges its parameters so that next time, “blue” feels less surprising. Over billions of tokens, GPT gradually shapes a belief system about how the world (or language) behaves — minimizing its surprise one word at a time.</p>

<p><strong>RL</strong></p>

<p>You often want to differentiate an expectation in reinforcement learning:</p>

\[\nabla_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_{\theta}(\cdot \mid s)}[f(a)]\]

<p>The gradient passes through the distribution $\pi_{\theta}$, so you get:</p>

\[\nabla_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\theta}} [f(a)] = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\theta}} \left[ f(a) \nabla_{\theta} \log \pi_{\theta}(a \mid s) \right]\]

<p>REINFORCE works by adjusting the policy by following the gradient of log  and shifting probability mass toward actions that surprised us but worked well.</p>

<p>Example: A robot tries random actions to push a block. Most fail; one odd shove suddenly works. That action was both surprising and rewarding. REINFORCE says: make that action less surprising next time — increase its probability. The gradient of log-probability literally points in the direction of “repeat what surprisingly worked.”</p>

<p>RL turns rewarding surprises into habits of expectation.</p>

<p><strong>Diffusion Models</strong></p>

<p>In Diffusion Models, the training objective minimizes the KL divergence  between the forward and reverse processes.</p>

<p>KL divergence is defined as:
\(D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p \,\|\, q) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p} \left[ \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \right]\)</p>

<p>Equivalently,
\(D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p \,\|\, q) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p} [\log p(x) - \log q(x)]\)</p>

<p>This can also be rewritten as:
\(D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p \,\|\, q) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p} [-\log q(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p} [-\log p(x)]\)</p>

<p>KL divergence thus measures how much <em>more</em> surprised you are, on average, using model $q$ than you would be if you had perfect knowledge of the true distribution $p$.</p>

<p>In diffusion models, the goal is to learn the <em>reverse</em> process $q_\theta$ that reconstructs data from noise. The training objective is:
\(\min_\theta \; D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p_{\text{forward}} \,\|\, q_\theta)\)</p>

<p>This can be interpreted as: Adjust the model parameters so that, on average, the model is no more surprised by the data than it would be if it knew the true forward distribution.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The forward process $p$ is the actual noise corruption process.</li>
  <li>The reverse model $q_\theta$ is the model’s belief about reversing the noise.</li>
</ul>

<p>KL divergence is the expected extra surprise due to an imperfect reverse model. Minimizing KL divergence means minimizing the model’s average surprise about what the forward process did, making the reverse prediction as unsurprising as possible.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What does this say, philosophically?</strong></p>

<p>In the end, modern ML is based on a metaphysics that model the world as dynamic, uncertain and evolving, rather than one with static categories and properties.</p>

<p>The linguistic turn (Frege to Russell to Wittgenstein to Carnap and early analytic philosophy) was motivated by the belief that philosophy’s task is to clarify the logical form of language, not to describe reality directly.  Classical and predicate logic are systems of symbol manipulation a linguistic fixation on truth and syntactic entailment.</p>

<p>Machine learning and information theory reorient us toward processes of wordly inference and information flow. In models the world as composed of processes,  Logic, therefore, should not model relations among propositions, but relations among actualities in becoming.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Nature is a structure of evolving processes. The reality is the process.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Information is not a property of sentences, but of relations among events</p>

<p>Hume argued that our belief that the future will resemble the past (e.g., the sun will rise tomorrow) inductive reasoning cannot be rationally justified by reason alone — it’s based on habit or custom, not logical necessity.</p>

<p>Our priors encode inductive expectations (that the world is stable, that causes persist, etc.), just like ….</p>

<hr />

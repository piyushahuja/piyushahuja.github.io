I"5$<p>There is a “way of be” in the world that is tantric.</p>

<p>It is non-reactive and relaxed.
It feels effortless, free, in the “flow of life”, genuine, authentic, “in integrity”.
All emotions are welcome, including: fear, anger, sadness (to investigate: what about “stress”, “anxiety”, “nervousness”, “jealousy”). 
It has heightened awareness of your own emotions, your senses. 
You see reality “as is”, including the emotions of others. 
You have needs, but you are not “needy”. You are not in a “getting” state. 
You give freeily, but do not “give to get”.
You are able to play and take risks.</p>

<p>Often I criticize myself for not being socially savvy, for not being able to make small talk or have conversations with beautiful women. But the reason I feel uncomfortable to talk to certain woman have nothing to do with ability, but often about the cues that I have subconsciously picked up on how the other person’s attitutde towards me.</p>

<p>Example: After the men-women reunion, I felt comfortable talking to Sarah, Kathy, Vanese, Stella, but not with Ingrid, Katie, etc. This was entirely due on them, and nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>It might be good to bring these cues to awareness, so that I communicate.</p>

<hr />

<p>Erring on the side of asking for permission always works: “Would you be comfortable texting?” rather than assuming one way or the other. If i assume too much, I might signal i am not good at boundaries, or am intrusive. If I assume too less, I might miss out on connection where possibility of connection exists.</p>

<ul>
  <li>May I hold your hand?</li>
  <li>Would you be comfortable talking about sexual matters?</li>
  <li>Would you be open to texting?</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I have trauma informed patterns</strong></p>

<p>Truth is, I was in a very different state of mind (and feeling) when I started this journey than I am now. It is impossible to recall how I my internal experience of myself used to be, but I remember the facts clearly:</p>

<p>I broke down in tears after Vanese’s initiation in LT1. Slowly at first, then violently when I realized that my beloved wouldnt not only look at me, but wouldnt even care for me. It felt pretty natural then, and was cathartic, but it was, in hindsight, what they call a “trauma response.” It triggered all those memories of not being loved, not being cared for, and importantly, of “being abandoned”. I had thoughts of “This, Again, Ofcourse”, “Would anyone ever love me?”, “I have to live with this pattern forever”.</p>

<p>I also got incredibly melancholic after the Men-Women reunion after LT1 in Florence House, after observing my beloved. Slowly at first, then back at the mattress. Mellower than the first, but this was also a “trauma response” that reminded me of all previous instances of false hope.</p>

<p>At the end of LT1, I spoke to Sarah about “I am not someone on the margin”. It was comletely informed by how I imagined she saw me, rather than how I was feeling.</p>

<p>I “got back” at Rich after my initiation in LT2. At the time, I felt in my power and proud of myself. And though difficult to see, this was also “a trauma response”. Was it? Although the response was informed by fear of “being bullied”. it was authentic and in tune with how I was feeling. It was also controlled. What it did lack was a mindful awareness of my feeling. And it definitely lacked awareness of all the other ways I could have responded, or channeled my energy. It was reactive, it lacked mindful choice.</p>

<p>Would I have the same reaction if the same series of events were to happen to me now?</p>

<p>Possibly not. I have received loved by the one I so desired love from in my LT1, I was chosen by the one I desired in Florence House LT1, and I have received love from Jo. I am lovable, I can be loved, I have been loved, I am loved and I will be loved.</p>

<p>Do I still have trauma informed pattenrs?</p>

<p>One is the “fear of being taken for granted”</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>When the inner critic is active, it reads a negative statement even in positive statements.</strong></p>

<p>When J observed “you’ve calmed down”, I received it as that she wants me to be more energetic. Whereas thats not what she meant; she wanted it slow.</p>

<p>When Serena started with “You have a lovely voice”, the inner critic was waiting for a “But…”</p>

<p>When Zephyr set different boundaries for me and Andrew, the inner critic convinced me it was about me. (it was merely because she had worked with Andrew before)</p>

<p>When Sandra walked past in LT3, the inner critic started thinking she must have made a judgement (she just wasn’t ready after having done cycles of relationship)</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Wheel of Consent</strong></p>

<p>An insight: an energetic transaction or exchange is not just about “give”
 and “take”, i.e. it is not single dimensional. One can “take” by giving, and “give” by taking”. It is two dimensional.</p>

<p>How does one give by taking? By taking from others for their own needs. By “allowing” others to give. When I allow my parents to give me advice that I do not need, I make them feel valued. I “give energy” by “taking” advice. Similarly, when J served me down there, I “gave her” (energetically) by taking (“physically”).</p>

<p>How does one take (i.e. for them, meet their own needs) by giving (on the surface)?  When I “give something” to meet my own needs (of self-esteem, or feeling good about myself e.g.). Rescuing to feel good about myself would fall toin this category. A good example is me giving an orgasm to D, with her giving me instructions. I was “giving” (physically) but it was for my needs (to learn). At the same time, D was giving me (energetically), by “allowing” me to give (physically).</p>

<p>Note that when one is taking (energetically) by giving (physically), the other is giving (energetically) by taking (physically).</p>

<p>Okay, so those are the counter-intutive ones. What about the straightforward ones?</p>

<p>How does one “give” by “giving” then? When I give something to others, “for others”. For example, me giving an orgasm to J.</p>

<p>How does one “take” (energetically) by “taking”? When J and me did it in the morning. When S and I did it.</p>

<p>In negotiations and marketing, acting as if you are “for the consumers” or “for the other party” while filling your own pockets is the norm. But when one does the same in interpersonal relationships, it translates to manipulative behavior.</p>

<p>It is useful to be aware of who is one acting for, energetically, when one does something physically.</p>

<p>Where does gratitude fit in?</p>

<p>Often when you give (energetically) to someone, there is gratitude at the other end. If there is no gratitude, the other did not “recognize” it as a gift that was for them.</p>

<p>When you are giving, do you get upset when the gift is not appreciated?  When there is no gratitude? Then it was probably for you.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>I was amused when Clara reciprocated my energy. She gave back to my giving, I imagine for a sense of equality and “not owing” gratitude. She did not “appreciate” my giving. But it did not cause me upset.</p>

<p>Richa does not show gratitude (for me agreeing to meet her). How does that make me feel? Confused, awkward, because she says she wants to meet, and I do it for her.</p>

<p>I was upset when Rosa didnt respond gracefully to the compliment. She did not give me gratitude. The compliment was probably “for me”.</p>

<hr />

<p>The wheel of consent is a clear example of how “energy” is a separate realm than the physical realm. It is the realm of consciousness, attention and intention. Operating in a different realm, the verbal one or the physical one, one can often end up either being manipulated, or being manipulative themselves.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>I tend to invent stories that makes me look good to myself</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“Laura  is secretly attracted to me”</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>I switch to fault finding mode when I imagine someone looks down on me</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Zephyr lacks self-awareness (didnt meet me where I was), Zephy prioritizes connection with her needs to such an extend that she is disrespectful to the needs of others, Zephy is highschoolish, clique, immature etc.</li>
  <li>Vic fears vulnerability and has a wrong idea of what it means to be tantric (not lack of vulnerability, but comfort with it).</li>
  <li>Josh is unware of his own flaws and doesnt understand that more knowledge is supposed to make someone more humble and aware of what they dont know, rather than arrogant and superior. Me being inspired by him is not an invitation to be looked down upon.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Creating insecurity is manipulative</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I did this when I said to S that “I am on a journey and I cannot say about the future”</li>
  <li>I did this with J when I said “I am popular and would be snogging others and be sensitive”</li>
</ul>

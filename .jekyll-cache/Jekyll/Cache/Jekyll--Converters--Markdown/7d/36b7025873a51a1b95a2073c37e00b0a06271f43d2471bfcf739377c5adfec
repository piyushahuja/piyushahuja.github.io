<p>Jarod Lanier points out our tendency “reduce ourselves” in order to make our description of them appear more accurate, “information underrepresents reality”</p>

<p>Whitman says “I am large, I contain multitudes”.</p>

<p>And Nietzche has an answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can man know himself?… For the most important inquiry, however, there is a method. Let the young soul survey its own life with a view of the following question: “What have you truly loved thus far? What has ever uplifted your soul, what has dominated and delighted it at the same time?” Assemble these revered objects in a row before you and perhaps they will reveal a law by their nature and their order: the fundamental law of your very self. Compare these objects, see how they complement, enlarge, outdo, transfigure one another; how they form a ladder on whose steps you have been climbing up to yourself so far; for your true self does not lie buried deep within you, but rather rises immeasurably high above you, or at least above what you commonly take to be your I.</p>

<p>This is how most people see me.</p>

<p>In terms of physical appearance, I have kind eyes that carry a twinkle or a sparkle, deep and resonant voice, warm and playful smile AND my facial skin has some scars, one can often detect an underlying sadness in my facial expressions, and male pattern baldness makes me look older than I am.</p>

<p>most salient virtues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>depth, wisdom, thoughtfulness, and intelligence</li>
  <li>humour, playfulness, wit</li>
  <li>genuineness, integrity, honesty, and commitment to truth</li>
  <li>curiosity, inquisitiveness</li>
  <li>kindness, care and warmth</li>
  <li>generosity</li>
  <li>openness</li>
</ul>

<p>stuff to work upon: I tend to keep myself quiet and small. I could embody more confidence and self-love.</p>

<p>Event: Oxford10 &amp; Cambridge10 joint Xmas social</p>

<p>She was on the end of the bar away from the entrance, speaking to another guy who looked to be of South East Asian origin, potentially British Indian. â€œOne of the wholesome onesâ€ is how my mind registered her presence as I continued mingling with others.</p>

<p>About twenty to thirty mins laterâ€¦</p>

<p>I am with a Romanian CS grad. We have chatted a bit about career and life, the conversation had become stale, and we consider joining up with others. We scan the room. â€œWho do we join? How do we join?â€ he asks me, like an earnest, good-natured but socially awkward living up to the software engineer sterotype.</p>

<p>I glance to my left. A group of three well dressed modern women, closed group, closed body language, in animated conversation with each other. Probably not welcoming.</p>

<p>I see two women approach the bar. One of them is her. â€œCome with meâ€, I say to my Romanian friend, with the air of the man who knows what heâ€™s doing. We walk up.</p>

<p>â€œHey, I donâ€™t think weâ€™ve met?â€
â€œHi I am Larissaâ€
â€œIâ€™m Piyushâ€
â€œAnd you? â€œ I turn to the other one
â€œI am Larissaâ€
â€œHang onâ€¦â€</p>

<p>And so it started. Both of them were Larissa, and theyâ€™d just met as well. We walk away from the crowd at the bar and form a group of four.</p>

<p>â€œSo I was in a class and the professor asked us â€œWhat does it mean to be human?â€â€¦what do you guys think?â€ she asks the group.</p>

<p>We chatter about. The discussion moves, as all do at some point in the times we live in, to AI and its impact.</p>

<p>The Romanian guy also has a party discussion prompt that he has been carrying. â€œWhat would you do if money were no object?â€ He asks the group.</p>

<p>Larissa would continue working in the field of work work she is in (international mitigation in human rights law), but she would choose the cases she would work on.</p>

<p>â€œWhat would you choose?â€ I ask her.</p>

<p>She seems taken aback, in a pleasant way, as if not prepared for that question. â€œThatâ€™s such an interesting question.â€ She sorts it out in her head in a jiffy and says â€œI would work on eliminating the death penaltyâ€.</p>

<p>The discusion moves on to death penalty and whether it can be justified. She makes the argument, one she heard from a professor, that it is</p>

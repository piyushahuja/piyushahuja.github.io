I"£<p>Creative insights are not as rare; what is rare is the conviction and courage to act on them. Everyone has moments of insight. However, it is common for one to not listen to them; when faced with something original and real, the human instinct is to shy away, embracing the comfort and security of the tried-and-tested. Listening to your insight or intution is a practiced skill. If not practice, it is dulled - to the extent that one is not able to tell their own thoughts from those of others. Other peopleâ€™s ideas start feeling as if they are your own; compare, for example, the authentic metaphors of a poet to the cliched and conventional vocabulary of a suit.</p>

<p>Realism, anti-realism, idealism, materialism and dualism.</p>

<p>Existence as what is expressed by the existential quantifier.</p>

<p>The view that there are non-existent objetcs</p>

<p>Quine view of ontology.</p>

<p>Internal vs external onotlogical questions.</p>

<p>Many of the issues can be organized around the following two questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Is existence a property of individuals? </li>
  <li>Assuming that existence is a property of individuals, are there individuals that lack it?</li>
</ul>

<p>Trace the issue of whether existence is a property to a disagreement between the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle and some of his medieval followers</p>

<ul>
  <li>the relationship between an individual’s essence and its existence.</li>
  <li>distinction between accident and essence. All contingent properties are accidents and all essences are necessary</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="universals-and-properties">Universals and Properties</h1>

<p>Should the properties an object has in common with other objects, such as color and shape, be considered to exist beyond those objects? And if a property exists separately from objects, what is the nature of that existence?</p>

<p>Universals are qualities or relations found in two or more entities.[3] As an example, if all cup holders are circular in some way, circularity may be considered a universal property of cup holders.[4] Further, if two daughters can be considered female offspring of Frank, the qualities of being female, offspring, and of Frank, are universal properties of the two daughters. Many properties can be universal: being human, red, male or female, liquid or solid, big or small, etc.</p>

<p>Philosophers agree that human beings can talk and think about universals, but disagree on whether universals exist in reality beyond mere thought and speech.</p>

<h1 id="time">Time</h1>

<p>Is it absurd to suppose that only the present exists?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To say that only present exists, is that the only thing in our world is there here and now, and any talk about the past or the future is much like a fictional talk, which has its referent as something which doesn’t exist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>McTaggart’s proof about hte unreality of time: When McTaggart says ‘‘Time involves change’’, it seems like a sleight of hand. What does it mean? Time is the dimension of change. But that doesn’t make anything clearer.
We observe time through A series and B series, or we observe the dimension of change through A series and B series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does tense indicate a feature of the world? Do tensed statements have tenseless truth conditions? Would that show that tense is unreal?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can later events affect earlier events? Is Time Travel possible?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="persistence-through-time">Persistence Through Time</h1>

<p>Material objects extend through space by having different spatial parts in different places. But how do they persist through time? According to some philosophers, things have temporal parts as well as spatial parts</p>

<p>If you have different temporal parts, this would explain how you can exist at different times, and it would also explain how you can have different properties at different times (you-yesterday hasn’t heard of temporal parts, you-tomorrow is an expert)</p>

<p>can we give criteria of identity through time for artefacts, animals or people? What happens to a ship if you replace all of its planks one by one? What if you keep the old planks, then build a new ship out of them? In addressing these questions during recent decades, however, it has proven useful to discuss whether objects have temporal parts, because the answers that philosophers give to these questions can often depend upon whether they believe in temporal parts.</p>

<p>Is causation analyzable in terms of counterfactuals?</p>

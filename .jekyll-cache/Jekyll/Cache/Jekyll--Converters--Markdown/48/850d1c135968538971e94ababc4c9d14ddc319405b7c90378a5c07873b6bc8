<p>Realism, anti-realism, idealism, materialism and dualism.</p>

<p>Existence as what is expressed by the existential quantifier.</p>

<p>The view that there are non-existent objetcs</p>

<p>Quine view of ontology.</p>

<p>Internal vs external onotlogical questions.</p>

<p>Many of the issues can be organized around the following two questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Is existence a property of individuals? </li>
  <li>Assuming that existence is a property of individuals, are there individuals that lack it?</li>
</ul>

<p>Trace the issue of whether existence is a property to a disagreement between the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle and some of his medieval followers</p>

<ul>
  <li>the relationship between an individual’s essence and its existence.</li>
  <li>distinction between accident and essence and that distinction’s relation to contingency and necessity.</li>
  <li>All contingent properties are accidents and all essences are necessary.</li>
  <li>Essential properties: A thing’s essential properties are inseparable from the bearer, not only in the sense that the property is necessarily had by that object (insofar as that object were to exist), but in the deeper sense that any adequate account of what that object is involves that property; they are part of any adequate definition of the thing or answer to the question ‘What is it?’.</li>
  <li>Essential vs necessary: I am essentially a human and perhaps essentially the person I in fact am, if there are individual essences in addition to general essences. I am necessarily identical to something and necessarily such that 2+2=4, but these properties are among my accidents, as they are not part of any adequate account of what I am and what distinguishes me from others.</li>
  <li>Aristotle: nothing more to existence than essence: “there is not a space between an articulation of what a thing is and that thing’s existing”
    <ul>
      <li>Hume: there is no impression of existence distinct from the impression of an object, which is ultimately on Hume’s view a bundle of qualities. As all of our contentful ideas derive from impressions, Hume concluded that existence is not a separate property of an object.</li>
      <li>Kant:  Thus when I think a thing, through whichever and however many predicates I like (even in its thoroughgoing determination), not the least bit gets added to the thing when I posit in addition that this thing is. For otherwise what would exist would not be the same as what I had thought in my concept, but more than that, and I could not say that the very object of my concept exists”  vs Proponents of the ontological argument argue that the concept of God as an entity with all perfections or a being of which no greater can be conceived entails God’s existence, as existence is a perfection and a being that exists is greater than a being that does not exist. Kant objected that existence is not a property.</li>
      <li>Frege:  existence is not a property of individuals but instead a second-order property—a property of concepts</li>
      <li>Russel: second-order property of propositional functions, to say that dinosaurs do not exist is to say that the property of being a dinosaur is not instantiated; to say that Jean-Baptiste Botul does not exist is to say that some property—say, the property of being a unique post-war critic of Kant and father of Butolism—is not instantiated. In neither case is it to say of some individual that it does not exist, which neither Frege nor Russell thought made sense.</li>
      <li>The view that existence is not a property of individuals became the common view in the early 20th Century. the thought, developed most forcefully by Russell, that denying that existence is a first-order property is the only way to avoid the consequence that there are things that do not exist and thus that there is a distinction between being and existing, our second framing question from above.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Aquinas:  One can have an understanding of what a man or a phoenix is without knowing whether it exists. So, existence is something in addition to essence. existence is a separate property as existence is not part of most objects’s natures and so those objects can be conceived or thought of separately from their existing.
    <ul>
      <li>Meinong: The thesis that there are things that do not exist was held by the Austrian philosopher Alexius Meinong. Existence is a genuine property of individuals, Meinong maintained, but not universally had.</li>
      <li>primary motivation is the puzzle of negative singular existentials—sentences that seem to truly assert the nonexistence of an individual, such as the sentence ‘Jean-Baptiste Botul does not exist’.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="universals-and-properties">Universals and Properties</h1>

<p>Should the properties an object has in common with other objects, such as color and shape, be considered to exist beyond those objects? And if a property exists separately from objects, what is the nature of that existence?</p>

<p>Universals are qualities or relations found in two or more entities.[3] As an example, if all cup holders are circular in some way, circularity may be considered a universal property of cup holders.[4] Further, if two daughters can be considered female offspring of Frank, the qualities of being female, offspring, and of Frank, are universal properties of the two daughters. Many properties can be universal: being human, red, male or female, liquid or solid, big or small, etc.</p>

<p>Philosophers agree that human beings can talk and think about universals, but disagree on whether universals exist in reality beyond mere thought and speech.</p>

<h1 id="time">Time</h1>

<p>Is it absurd to suppose that only the present exists?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To say that only present exists, is that the only thing in our world is there here and now, and any talk about the past or the future is much like a fictional talk, which has its referent as something which doesn’t exist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>McTaggart’s proof about hte unreality of time: When McTaggart says ‘‘Time involves change’’, it seems like a sleight of hand. What does it mean? Time is the dimension of change. But that doesn’t make anything clearer.
We observe time through A series and B series, or we observe the dimension of change through A series and B series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does tense indicate a feature of the world? Do tensed statements have tenseless truth conditions? Would that show that tense is unreal?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can later events affect earlier events? Is Time Travel possible?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="persistence-through-time">Persistence Through Time</h1>

<p>Material objects extend through space by having different spatial parts in different places. But how do they persist through time? According to some philosophers, things have temporal parts as well as spatial parts</p>

<p>If you have different temporal parts, this would explain how you can exist at different times, and it would also explain how you can have different properties at different times (you-yesterday hasn’t heard of temporal parts, you-tomorrow is an expert)</p>

<p>can we give criteria of identity through time for artefacts, animals or people? What happens to a ship if you replace all of its planks one by one? What if you keep the old planks, then build a new ship out of them? In addressing these questions during recent decades, however, it has proven useful to discuss whether objects have temporal parts, because the answers that philosophers give to these questions can often depend upon whether they believe in temporal parts.</p>

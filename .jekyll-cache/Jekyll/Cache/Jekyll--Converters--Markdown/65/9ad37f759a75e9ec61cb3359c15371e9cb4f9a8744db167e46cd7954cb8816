<p>Why are adverbs considered to be evil?</p>

<p>Most writers have this goal: to transfer an image from their minds into the minds of readers. And they want readers to be as struck by that image as possible.  If a writer sends me “cat,” I may receive the word, but just receiving isn’t good enough. I may receive it and forget about it a moment later. Writers want to transfer images, and they want those images to STICK.  Which means they must describe those images in a way that’s as vivid and sensual as possible. (Sensual, because we experience through our senses, so if you can con a reader into believing he’s seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling or touching, you win.) Most writing-rules boil down to this: “lick the reader.” If you lick his face, he’ll remember you.  For instance, we avoid the passive-voice because it doesn’t lick the reader’s face. (Though, perhaps, the reader’s face is licked.) When I first wrote the paragraph two places above this one, I started it “Which means images must be described…” it’s hard to imagine images being described. Being described by <em>whom?</em> The easiest sentences to see are the ones in which an agent does something TO something. So I rewrote it as “they [the writers] must describe…” It’s still not great, because “describe” is a weak verb – one that doesn’t evoke a strong image – but at least I’m evoking the idea of a writer DOING SOMETHING and not of something just happening. But you don’t have to remember to avoid modifiers if, instead, you write to spark the senses. <strong>“Avoid modifiers” is an okay way of achieving of forcing yourself to write more sensually, because if you’re robbed of modifiers, you have to pick vivid nouns and verbs to get your idea across.</strong> A person can point to a tree, and a person can run, but a person can’t dangerously. It’s impossible to imagine dangerously. There is no such thing as dangerously. It’s possible to imagine dancing dangerously or holding a knife dangerously, but these phrases put a burdon on the reader. He must first evoke “holding a knife.” Then he must add “dangerously” to it. You run the risk that he won’t: that he’ll just mush everything together into some vague “understanding” of what you’re trying to evoke. The worst thing a writer can achieve is his reader “getting the point.” <strong>You don’t want the reader to get the point. You want to lick his face.</strong> Which of the following is easier to imagine? “talking quietly” or “whispering”? “walking nervously” or “pacing”?
“acting aggressively” or “fighting”?</p>

I"ÁN<p>I have a taste for writing. When a piece of writing is <em>good</em>, I can tell. When a piece of writing is crap, I can tell too. Every now and then I can even tell how to turn crappy writing into something good: remove or replace a word, rearrange that phrase, come up with a more fitting metaphor. If I have written something that is not good enough, it doesn‚Äôt sit well with me: I feel a mental itch to make it better.</p>

<p>Not everyone has a taste for writing. Some people cannot read at all. Others, when given an exquisite piece of text, cry out in frustration,¬†  ‚ÄúWhat are they trying to say!?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy not use simpler words?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt they use bullet points?‚Äù And then there are well-meaning folks who say, in the spirit of all-encompassing acceptance,  ‚Äúwho decides what is good and what is bad? Anything goes! It‚Äôs all human expression!‚Äù (set this ‚Äúobjectivity of aesthetics‚Äù discussion aside for a moment, will you?)</p>

<p>One can find principles of good writing. ‚ÄúDo not use filler words‚Äù, ‚ÄúShow, Don‚Äôt Tell‚Äù, ‚ÄúPrefer action verbs to nouns and adverbs‚Äù. Many of them are taught in writing schools. And to some extent, being mindful of these can make your writing better. But great writing seems to be doing something different. It often deviates from these principles in just the right moments. It has a sense of naturalness and truth and aliveness and energy and electricity and flow and expansiveness. I suspect this is because great writers are not conscientiously following the principles of good writing, but following something else: their taste. Or feelings. Or inner experience.  And those things are prior to any principles.</p>

<p>Some people have a refined taste for food. ‚ÄúCorrect me if I‚Äôm wrong, but do I sense a dash of coriander in this?‚Äù, they say.  Not only can they tell when something tastes good, but can also suggest how to make something taste better. ‚ÄúThis needs more salt‚Äù; ‚Äúthis could do with a squeeze of lemon‚Äù.</p>

<p>If you do not have a taste for food, comments like that might leave you scratching your head. If that is you, you also probably tend to gobble down good food without relishing it, just like those who do not have a finer appreciation for literature will go through a well-written text without enjoying it. And you might not be able to tell if a dish can be improved by an addition of salt or seasoning just like those without a taste for literature are not able to tell how to make it better with a change of word or rearrangement of a phrase.</p>

<p>Just like there are principles that can make writing better: there are principles of what makes something taste good. Salt enhances flavour, acid balances it, and fat carries it. A delicious meal is something that indulges more than one of our taste centres: the more the better. Salted Caramel tastes better than either salt or caramel: putting the salty and the sweet together produces something much better than the sum of its parts. So it is with lemonade (sour, sweet, salty). Or coffee and chocolate (bittersweet). A second one: a contrast in texture works well. A runny eggs and a crisp toasty bread make each other better, a perfect grilled cheese sandwhich has a crusty exterior and a soft interior, so does a Victoria sponge cake.</p>

<p>As in writing, taste is prior to principles: the principles are common patterns found in what tastes good, they are post-hoc abstractions. A person with good taste is not someone who is mechanically following the principles of good taste - it is not the case that the person tastes something and goes ‚Äúthis does not adhere to the principles, so it tastes bad!‚Äù. Rather, they are actually <em>tasting</em>, they are experiencing, and it is their senses that feed them back the feeling of ‚Äúyummy‚Ä¶soooo good‚Äù or ‚Äúew, something is off with this!‚Äù</p>

<hr />

<p>I used to imagine myself as one who does not possess a proper sense of taste. That I don‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù food, that I am not a foodie, that food is merely fuel for my body and I am happy to eat anything. Basically, a thought of the form ‚Äúthis  spoonful of sauce that just touched base with my tongue could do with more salt‚Äù would never occur to me.</p>

<p>But this view that I held of myself wasn‚Äôt completely accurate. If I paid any attention to what I actually did (rather than what I told myself),<sup id="fnref:else" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:else" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I would have observed that I don‚Äôt just eat everything willy-nilly. Instead, I would leave out any discernible pieces of tomatoes when presented a salad: as if on auto-pilot. On a supermarket aisle, I would rarely buy carrots or potatoes. When choosing items from a menu, I would gravitate towards certain items and away from others. There were certain eateries I would want to visit again and again, almost instinctually. And I had lots of memories of food that, at the time I tasted it, had made my eyes lit up and made me go ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like some more of that, please!‚Äù.<sup id="fnref:list" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:list" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>So, my body did have a sense of taste and it did reveal preferences for food in behavior. I wasn‚Äôt just aware of those preferences. Bringing it to awareness was a starting point in deepening my sense of taste.</p>

<p>Cooking without tasting is like sketching blindfolded. While tasting well does not require one to know how to cook (it doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt know ‚Äòhow the sausage is made‚Äô), and while one can produce a good meal by merely following a recipe, the true art and genius of cooking lies in improvisation, in adjusting balance on-the-go, in paying attention to the actual experience of tasting something and using it to ask ‚ÄúWhat could I do to make this taste better?‚Äù. Cooking well requires tasting well.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbk9MhZyWKY">Cooking Scene from Perfect Sense</a></p>

<p>Some people seem to have a ‚Äúnatural hand‚Äù for cooking. I think those who are not natural at cooking must be doing something similar to what I used to do when I started to cook: I would treat the recipe like a fixed algorithm, to be followed to the dot. I would pay no attention to food as it was cooking (as a result, I would often end up undercooking the tomato. Or steaming the chicken surface, instead of browning it). I would eat cooked food quickly rather than taste mindfully. And I paid no heed to seasonings like salt, lemon and fat, thinking them unimportant. In short, I would cook a meal like a computer might produce mathematical proof or an AI might write a poem: without <em>‚Äúgetting it</em>‚Äù<sup id="fnref:AI" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:AI" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ultuqYot5yE">Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a></p>

<p>But if you‚Äôd asked me then, I wouldn‚Äôt have known that I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúget it‚Äù; I didn‚Äôt even know there was something to ‚Äúget‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt care about my experience of taste, so whatever I cooked worked for me. I would wolf it down. If I did notice something off with it, I would double down on the precision of the proportions and the timings outlined in the recipe next time. The result might have been better. It might have even been outstanding, just like a poem generated by AI might have technical merits. But I still wouldn‚Äôt have <em>‚Äúgot it‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>If I did ‚Äúget it‚Äù, I would have found that it is not necessary to follow a recipe to exactitude. The same ingredients can vary in taste - even tomatoes growing in different sides of the same tree can differ. A recipes might ask for two tablespoons of olive oil for two onions, but if pan has large surface area, that probably won‚Äôt be enough to coat it - one of the ways  recipe writers detemine the quantity of oil to be used. So one has to pay attention to food as it cooks, and look for the right signs. Is the bottom of the pan is coated with fat when sautering? Is the oil hot enough for chicken to brown? Is the surface of chicken dry? Does the oil comes halfway up the sides of the food when shallow-frying? Do onions look like how they should look when sweated, browned, or caramelised? (one has to know how onions look like at different stages of cooking). Does the sauce taste bland or bitter, does it need more salt? Is it overly sweet or sour? One tastes as food cooks, and adjusts on the go.  And for that one has know the actual tasting experience they are trying to ‚Äúget at‚Äù. That requires a sensitivity to what is good taste, and what is bad taste.  Good cooking is not just about memorizing a recipe and following it to the tee: instead, it is about seeing, smelling, tasting. It is about the senses.</p>

<hr />

<p>For a while, I thought <em>getting it</em> meant <em>understanding it</em>.</p>

<p>I held the idea that cooking didnt sustain my attention because I did not understand the ‚Äúwhys‚Äù of cooking: Why do I preheat the pan before adding the oil? Why not let both heat up together? Why to put ingredients in oil when it is sizzling hot? Why not do it at the start, so one can save up on the heat? Why pat dry the chicken before cooking? Why leave it to rest after cooking? Why this thing goes after that thing, and not before? Does marination affect meat? <em>Does it now, really?</em></p>

<p>To understand the magic, I read Samir Nosrat‚Äôs excellent book: <em>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</em>, turned my kitchen into a laboratory, and simultaneously embarked on some cooking experiments to test the principles therein.<sup id="fnref:experiment" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:experiment" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>I found some answers in chemistry, some in practical logic. It is recommended to ‚Äúpat dry‚Äù the chicken before browning it because the water on the surface might otherwise lead to steaming the chicken. That will cook the chicken, but it wont brown it. The browning is a result of Maillard Reaction that only happens above the boiling point of water. Water escapes as steam when temperatures rise, so we need another medium: oil. If put the chicken before we heat is oil, it might start cooking before the desired temperature for Maillard Reaction has been achieved, and might lead to chicken that is overcooked. We also cook both sides of the surface of the chicken first, to ‚Äúseal in the moisture‚Äù, so that the inside stays juicy and tender. If the inside is cooked before the outside has been sealed, it might lose moisture and become dry and rubbery. And allowing the chicken to rest after cooking allows the protein to settle, which allows it to retain moisture for longer, leading to a juicier texture.</p>

<p>Recipes also follow inner logic depending on their ingredients. The sequence is constrained by how long each ingredient takes to cook and how they affect each other. In Indian cooking, whole spices take longer to cook and so they are the first thing that go in. They‚Äôre cooked in fat or oil because spices require temporature much above boiling point of water to cook properly, and oil achieves that without being vaporised. (Also unlike water, fat also coats the toungue and allowing aromatic flavours to remain in contact with our taste buds for longer). Onions take a while to cook, too, so added early with the spices. Garlic, if overcooked, turns bitter so it only cooked for 1-2 mins. Tomatoes are added only after onions are cooked because the acid in tomatoes can prevent the softening of onions. The acid in tomatoes can also prevent the salt from dissolving and distributing evenly in the dish if added too early, so salt is added only after tomato is partially cooked. Dairy should be added to acidic dishes at the last minute because otherwise it will curdle.</p>

<p>All this understanding added meaning to the activity of cooking. Once I realised the rationale and relevance of each instruction, I was more likely to pay it its due respect.  But did it help me see, smell, taste? Did it make me more likely to taste a sample of my stew, and say to myself ‚Äúit needs more salt!‚Äù?</p>

<p>It didn‚Äôt. But with the cookbook, my blind tasting experiments, and crucially - the positive awareness that I did have taste, I arrived at the truth that is likely obvious to almost everyone, and was staring me in the face all this time. The ultimate answer to the ‚Äúwhys‚Äù of a recipe, something that lies at the foundation to the inquiries of chemistry and the evolution of cooking practices, lies in the actual experience of taste (well, apart from health and safety - but put that discussion aside for a moment, will you?). A chicken browned has complex flavours in its crispy extrior and is moist and tender in its interior, and this is delicious!</p>

<p>Your body wants this piece of tender, juicy, crispy chicken! It wants it not because not for someone else, not because others also seem to like it, not for some moral good, not for society‚Äôs conventions, not because it is supposed to do so, not for some status, not because it would make you thinner, beautiful, healthier, not for some developing muscle mass,  but because it is fundamentally pleasurable to your sense of taste. Your lived experience matters, and often, it is all that matters.</p>

<p>Crucially - you, and other peope wanting the same delicious experience, is the primary motivating force for cooking in the way we do. If one works backwards from the experience, all the steps one needs to do to get there follow automatically; the wisdom and knowledge contained in the recipe is a mere by-product. To cultivate the skill of improvisation in cooking, to adjust-on-the-go, to understand balance, to be able to make a dish taste better, to invent new dishes from the leftovers in your referigerator, one need only pay attention to their sense of taste. And it is possible to answer to why this, or why that,  with the foundational reason: ‚Äúit tastes better that way than otherwise‚Äù. Those who have cultivated this sense, paid attention to it, and gained wisdom from it, are the ones who ‚Äúget it‚Äù. And that‚Äôs all there is to it.</p>

<p><em>Understanding it</em> was not the same as <em>getting it</em>. I had sought out the whys of cooking to satisfy a niggling sense of ‚Äúlack‚Äù in my refined perception of taste. But without paying attention to my own experience, I was looking in the realm of reason for something that belonged only in the realm of sense, feeling and experience.<sup id="fnref:think" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:think" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> It was a wrong turn, a red herring, a dead end, a blind alley.<sup id="fnref:love" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:love" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:anxiety" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:anxiety" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<hr />

<p>With the awareness of my taste preference: what I liked, and what I did not, and a new interest and attentiveness to my experience of taste, it was like I flipped a switch. A lightbulb went off, and a new reality of lived everyday experience revealed itself to me.</p>

<p>It wasn‚Äôt so much that I did not have a taste perception earlier, it wasn‚Äôt like I was blind earlier and now I could see. Instead, I thought I was blind earlier when I actually wasn‚Äôt just looking.</p>

<p>wasn‚Äôt aware of it and did not cultivate it, and now I did</p>

<p>How people respond to food in common culture started making sense, and it became increasingly difficult for me to continue to gobble down bland unseasoned food when a little addition of salt or a squeeze of lemon could make my experience much better at no extra cost.</p>

<p>I finally got ‚Äúit‚Äù.</p>

<hr />

<p>You might be thinking, that all this is amusing. The more of a functional relationship with food and awareness of taste one has, the more amusing it might sound. But my primary contention is that the this attunement, attention, awareness to one of our senses: taste, can be present to a greater or lesser degree of refinement, and that it can be cultivated to more or less.</p>

<p>OCD: Following the instinct only increases it. 
Autism: Repetitive behavior doesnt help get outside the loop.
Asperger cry ‚ÄúAdults dont seem to follow the rules!‚Äù
‚ÄúI am not beautiful‚Äù -&gt; Why not start with people who do find you beautiful?
‚ÄúI am not loved‚Äù -&gt; Why not be more attentive to when you receive love.

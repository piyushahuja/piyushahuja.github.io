My technique is to write an email. Not one Iâ€™ll ever send, but one Iâ€™ll actually write in gmail, rather than in a word processor, even if itâ€™s an essay or short story. (Gmail is great for this, because it saves drafts, so you can start and stop.) I pick an appropriate person to write to, usually a non-expert, and explain my idea, make my appeal, defend my claim, tell my funny story â€¦</p>

<p>The act of composing an email and writing it to a specific person forces my brain into a conversational mode.</p>

<p>Later, I cut the text into a word processor and redraft it, removing â€œDear Mom,â€ or whatever. Poor Mom never gets the letter.</p>

<p>I read everything I write aloud. Everything. If Iâ€™m worried about disturbing the people around me, I mouth the words. The act of vocalizing (or at least making mouth movements) helps just as much as the email technique. My brain becomes less writerly and more talky.</p>

<p>And I simply avoid hifalutin words. I donâ€™t completely shun them, if I insist on writing â€œambulate,â€ Iâ€™d better have a good reason. As I redraft, I hunt them down and shoot them in the head, replacing them with their homlier cousins. â€œTake that, â€˜vehicle!â€™ Blam! Iâ€™m replacing you with â€˜car.â€™â€</p>

<p>Being specific helps. Most stodgy writing is laced with abstractions. Just writing â€œchairâ€ instead of â€œarticle of furnitureâ€ goes a long way towards thawing frigid prose.</p>

<p>When in doubt, I ask a friend to read a draft. I tell him to underline anything obscure, forced, academic, or formal sounding. And I assume heâ€™s always right.</p>

<hr />

<p>Do not affect a breezy manner.</p>

<p>The volume of writing is enormous, these days, and much of it has a sort of windiness about it, almost as though the author were in a state of euphoria. â€œSpontaneous me,â€ sang Whitman, and, in his innocence, let loose the hordes of uninspired scribblers who would one day confuse spontaneity with genius.</p>

<p>The breezy style is often the work of an egocentric, the person who imagines that everything that comes to mind is of general interest and that uninhibited prose creates high spirits and carries the day. Open any alumni magazine, turn to the class notes, and you are quite likely to encounter old Spontaneous Me at workâ€“an aging collegian who writes something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€˜Well, guys, here I am again dishing the dirt about your disorderly classmates, after passing a weekend in the Big Apple trying to catch the Columbia hoops tilt and then a cab-ride from hell through the West Side casbah. And speaking of news, howzabout tossing a few primo items this way?â€™</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an extreme example, but the same wind blows, at lesser velocities, across vast expanses of journalistic prose. The author in this case has managed in two sentences to commit most of the unpardonable sins: he obviously has nothing to say, he is showing off and directing the attention of the reader to himself, he is using slang with neither provocation nor ingenuity, he adopts a patronizing air by throwing in the word primo, he is humorless (though full of fun), dull, and empty. He has not done his work.</p>

<p>How do good writers develop their â€œvoiceâ€? How similar is it to their spoken voice?

Voice is tension between natural speech and a more heightened, polished, and poetic tone. Itâ€™s the way you talk at your best. Your writing should read like something you might â€œjust say,â€ but stripped of all the clunk and clutter; spruced up with lush images â€“ but not so lush they seem forced.</p>

<p>To the extent I pull this off, I do it by making at least three drafts. The first is the â€œget it on paperâ€ draft, when I donâ€™t worry about voice at all. I just dump my thoughts on the page (or screen). Editing is way easier than writing, so itâ€™s vital I have something â€“ anything â€“ to edit. As a barfly once told me, â€œSpew first. Clean it up later.â€</p>

<p>The second draft is a combo of heightening it and making it flow. By â€œheightening,â€ I donâ€™t mean planting all sorts of flowery phrases. I mean coming up with stronger images than I originally dumped onto the page. I may sneak in a quirky, surprising word here and there. Heightening is about slipping that hint of jalapeÃ±o into the cupcake â€“ just to keep the reader awake.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also in this draft that I go through each sentence, seeing if thereâ€™s a way to sneak one of the five senses into it somehow. Can I make the reader feel heâ€™s seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touching something?</p>

<p>I worry over things like rhythm and repetition. Did I bombard the reader with a blast of bombastic b-sounds? Hmm. I might have added some cupcake to my jalapeÃ±o.</p>

<p>Did I use boring words too much? â€œI think we should think harder about teaching ourselves to think about stuff.â€ Yes, in everyday speech I blurt out that kind of crap. But Iâ€™m shooting for â€œme and my best.â€ Iâ€™m not going to change it to â€œI conclude we ought to aggressively cogitate re our pedagogical approach to ruminations,â€ because itâ€™s not remotely how I talk. â€œMe at my bestâ€ is not a stilted academic. Nor is it a saccharine Halmark employee.</p>

<p>But maybe Iâ€™ll change it to â€œWe should delve into our thoughts,â€ because I might actually say that. Iâ€™ll use a thesaurus at this stage, looking up â€œthink.â€ Iâ€™ll try out metaphors (well, I already did when I used the word â€œdelve,â€ but Iâ€™ll audition some more overt ones) like â€œWe should stick our index fingers in our ears, root around in our brains, and nudge our thoughts in neat little rows.â€ Is that still reasonably â€œthe way I talkâ€ or is it â€œtoo writerlyâ€? Voice tends to happen right at the edge.</p>

<p>The third draft is almost entirely about flow. This is where it really comes down to personal taste, but I prefer conversational to writerly. So I go through it again only worrying about â€œdoes it sound like a guy talking to you?â€ He can be a quirky guy, but he has to be a guy (or gal).</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the most important tip: read it aloud! You must, must, must do this. I do it during draft two and three, but itâ€™s absolutely vital during draft three. And donâ€™t cheat: donâ€™t read it in your head imaging youâ€™re reading it aloud. Thereâ€™s some â€œdoes this sound rightâ€ brain module thatâ€™s only switched on when the muscles of your mouth are moving. I read everything I write aloud, even Quora posts. And I donâ€™t catch a lot of clunkiness until I do it.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re in the office or the coffee shop, and you canâ€™t read aloud without embarrassing yourself and disturbing your neighbor, then go Hassidic and move your lips. Read â€œaloudâ€ silently, but make sure your lips, tongue and jaw are engaged, so that your brain goes through the â€œIâ€™m speaking aloudâ€ process.</p>

<p>Last tip: if you canâ€™t find your voice, write in gmail instead of Word. Pick a friend who might be interested and tell him your story (essay or whatever) in a letter. Donâ€™t send it (unless you want to). You can copy and paste it into Word when youâ€™re done. Itâ€™s very hard to write for â€œa general audience.â€ That can make you lose your voice, because we developed voices to talk to real, flesh-and-blood people. So â€œtalkâ€ to someone. Then edit that â€œconversationâ€ into a poem, story, or essay.</p>

<hr />

<p>Hereâ€™s how I drafted the first paragraph, starting with the initial dump:</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s no right answer for every writer. But for me, voice is a fun tension between the way I naturally talk and something more heightened, polished, and poetic. Itâ€™s the way I talk when Iâ€™m at my best. It should always sound believably like something I might â€œjust say.â€ But it should be stripped of all the clunky things I say. It should just happen to be more sensually evocative than my speech generally is.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s my process during draft two, with the bracketed and italicized parts indicating cuts and the boldface parts indicating additions:</p>

<p>[Thereâ€™s no one right answer for every writer. But for me,] voice is [a fun] the tension between the way [I] you naturally talk and [something] a more heightened, polished, and poetic tone. Itâ€™s the way [I] you talk [when Iâ€™m] at [my] your best. It should always sound believably like something [I] you might â€œjust say.â€ But stripped of all the clunk[y things I say] and clutter. [It should just happen to be more sensually evocative than my speech generally is.] With richer, sexier images than the ones that tend to roll off your tongue. But not so rich they seem forced.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the result:</p>

<p>Voice is the tension between the way you naturally talk and a more heightened, polished, and poetic tone. Itâ€™s the way you talk at your best. It should always sound believably like something you might â€œjust say.â€ But stripped of all the clunk and clutter. With richer, sexier images than the ones that tend to roll of your tongue. But not so rich they seem forced.</p>

<p>Next edit, for flow (and also some condensing):</p>

<p>Voice is [the] tension between [the way you] naturally [talk] speech and a more heightened, polished, and poetic tone. Itâ€™s the way you talk at your best. [It] Your writing should [always sound] read [believably] like something you might â€œjust say,â€ but stripped of all the clunk and clutter; spruced up with [richer, sexier] lush images [than the ones that tend to roll of your tongue] â€“ but not so [rich] lush they seem forced.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the result:</p>

I love your tip about gmail and actually use it regularly.</p>

<p>I have a hard time cosigning (or rejecting, for that matter) anything about writing voiceâ€¦ It varies so much. Iâ€™ve seen ostentatious but indescribably amazing voices, and also voices that that are so simple that you donâ€™t even recognize them as voice unless you stop and analyze. And neither necessarily has anything to do with how anyone talks. Especially if itâ€™s an author who is preternaturally gifted at writing many voices, all unlike him/herself.</p>

Yes. I think itâ€™s kind of like acting. In the theatre, we are always talking about â€œtruth,â€ but I think itâ€™s a kind of shorthand for â€œunityâ€ â€“ of a character being true to himself. In other words, all his parts connecting somehow.</p>

<p>So a writer can speak in many voices as long as each one is unified: as long as thereâ€™s some kind of inner logic to the voice.</p>

<p>We donâ€™t have to think, â€œI believe the author would really say that in real life.â€ But we do have to believe that Daisy and Gatsby and Nick would each really say whatever it is theyâ€™re saying in real life.</p>

<p>Some people are naturally wordy or whatever. The thing is, as a writer, you have to be able to pull of that voice in a way that feels natural.</p>

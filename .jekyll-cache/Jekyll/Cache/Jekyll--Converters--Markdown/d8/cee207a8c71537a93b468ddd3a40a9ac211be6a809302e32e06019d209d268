  <p>A New Precaution.  Let us no longer think so much about punishing, blaming, and improving!  We shall seldom be able to alter an individual, and if we should succeed in doing so, something else may also succeed, perhaps unawares: we may have been altered by him!  Let us rather see to it that our own influence on all that is to come outweighs and overweighs his influence!  Let us not struggle in direct conflict!  All blaming, punishing, and desire to improve comes under this category.  But let us elevate ourselves all the higher!  Let us ever give to our pattern more shining colours!  Let our brilliance make them look dark.  No, we do not mean to become darker ourselves on their account, like those who punish and are discontented!  Let us rather go aside!  Let us look away!</p>

Conflict arose, and they decided to go to a wise old woman for assistance. After thinking about it for a while, she said, â€œHere. Iâ€™ll give you one of my camels.â€ Now with 18 camels, the first son took 1/2: (9), the second son took 1/3: (6), and the last son took 1/9: (2), and they had a camel left over and they gave it back to the woman.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Persuasion is about changing someoneâ€™s mind.  Persuasion comes down to: connecting with people, empathising (inhabiting their point of view and making them see yours), and making them feel good about themselves.</p>

<p>Negotiation, particularly principled negotiation, is about problem solving. This amounts to separating people from the problem, empathising with them and what they want, and using objective criteria to agree on one of the options that gives mutual gain.</p>

<p>Both activities require common abilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>active listening</li>
  <li>empathy</li>
  <li>making people feel good</li>
  <li>getting people to see your point of view</li>
  <li>reframing or breaking frames</li>

  <li>Talk around the idea, only indirectly suggesting it <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-plant-ideas-in-someones-mind-5715912">How to plant an idea in someoneâ€™s mind</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Underlying every idea someone has lies a more subtle, hidden fantasy of what is actually driving them. An emotional narrative the person built around what they want to do. Theyâ€™re often not aware of it. If you need to convince someone to do something, donâ€™t pitch your idea. Instead, pitch the underlying idea fantasy to someone who would enjoy it. Similarly, if you want to convince someone not to do something, you need to understand their true motivation. Donâ€™t debate at the surface.</p>

<p>Suppose someone wants to get a new job. Theyâ€™ll tell friends â€œthey want to growâ€ or â€œdonâ€™t feel like theyâ€™re learning in their current jobâ€. Debating the points they bring up with you wonâ€™t help because that isnâ€™t what is really motivating them to leave. True motivation is often simpler: they heard a friend is making much more money than them. They met someone at the new job they really like. They havenâ€™t been sleeping well, and theyâ€™re just tired. The fantasy thatâ€™s stuck in their mind is a mental image of themselves making more money, being near a person they admire or being more well-rested. You need to determine what that is.</p>

<p>Counter-position. Donâ€™t try to compete with their fantasy. Like Kellyanne Conway answering a question, just pitch a different one. If you suspect someone the fantasy in the future job is â€œI will make more moneyâ€, donâ€™t immediately offer a raise. Pitch another something else, e.g: â€œthere will be real opportunity for public recognition in this roleâ€. Donâ€™t make your idea comparable to another idea.</p>

<p>Listen. Try to ascertain what the person really wants. This requires listening at a whole new level. When they talk, notice what causes their eyes their eyes to light up. Pay attention to their posture. Once you start paying attention to the details, youâ€™ll realize other humans are the most interesting thing in the world.</p>

<p>Direct a movie. Suppose you want someone to quit smoking. The fantasy you want to plant is how youthful theyâ€™ll feel when they stop. The most effective way to incept a person isnâ€™t to say those words. Instead, say something like: â€œit must feel wonderful to run 3 miles in the wilderness, take a breath of fresh air and really live life.â€ Conduct a movie in the mind with words that evoke vivid imagery. It makes for a much more engaging conversation.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t pre-suppose solutions. Instead of thinking of what you want (â€œyou should build this thingâ€), think of why you want it (â€œthis thing could be really successful, if someone built itâ€). Try to formulate a narrative around the underlying motivations for the idea, and let them think of the actual concept themselves. Give context, not commands.</p>

<p>Pitch theoretically. When youâ€™re in a biased position, donâ€™t make any direct suggestions (â€œyou shouldâ€). Your idea may get auto-rejected because of its origin. Instead, use yourself or a theoretical stranger (â€œI wouldâ€¦â€, â€œboy somebody ought toâ€¦â€).</p>

  <p>You canâ€™t just say â€œoh, I read today that fried chicken is killing 10 million children in Arkansas every yearâ€ because thatâ€™s a load of crap and comes with an incredibly obvious motivation for saying it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If chicken is the target, you need to make chicken seem really unappealing. Next time you sneeze, make a joke about coming down with the avian flu. When youâ€™re ordering at a restaurant together, verbally convey your decision to order something other than chicken because you just learned how most chicken is processed by restaurants. When youâ€™ve done enough of these thingsâ€”and, again, with enough space between them so that it doesnâ€™t seem like odd behaviorâ€”you can start being a little more aggressive and stop going with your friend to get fried chicken. You can also take proactive steps to improve your own health and tell your friend 1) what youâ€™re doing, and 2) how well itâ€™s working for you. After a few weeks, if your friend hasnâ€™t decided to reconsider his or her position on frequent fried chicken, you can casually mention it and they should be much more open to having a real discussion.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Buyer: I have a 2-year old Windows laptop and I need it to store my photos. I have about 30GB of photos.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You: 250GB is definitely more than enough for just storing your photos, so as long as you donâ€™t have many more files you might want to put onto the drive it should be just fine for your needs.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>In group reinforcement: show people youâ€™re on the same team, while gently ridiculing the extremes of those whose ideas are against yours.</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>â€œYou want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?â€</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>When you openly try to convince someone, youâ€™re taking the posture of being their superior. They are likely to spend their time thinking of all the reasons your ideas are somewhere between biased and insane. Bias and insanity are easy to find in other peopleâ€™s ideas but hard to find in your own. If you really want to persuade somebody, to change their mind, social ploys rather than debate techniques work far better.</p>

    <p>Donâ€™t attack their views. Instead, gently ridicule people whose ideas are more extreme than theirs. Ridicule makes them want to flee those ideas and assure you that they stand closer to you.</p>

    <p>But the ridicule must be gentle and teasing, and with luck genuinely funny.  Nongentle ridicule, however, makes you look mean and increases sympathy for your victim.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Johnny Carson destroyed Jerry Brownâ€™s first presidential bid by calling him Governor Moonbeam on the Tonight Show every night. It never sounded mean, but it trivialized Brown.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The key is, never show anger or scorn for the person youâ€™re trying to persuade. You must always invite them into your company and speak as if you agree on what â€œreally matters.â€</p>

    <p>Youâ€™ll notice that none of this involves logic or reason or evidence. Itâ€™s really about inviting them into the in-group of cool, smart, reasonable people like you. It takes time, but it gradually changes their attitude until they find their former ideas faintly ridiculous, so theyâ€™re happy theyâ€™re now among the superior people.</p>

    <p>Thatâ€™s how you change peopleâ€™s minds. If you find that distasteful, then by all means keep engaging people in direct debate, â€œwinâ€ every time, and leave them resentful and unconvinced. They will change their mind only on one point: They will resolve never to discuss things with you again.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™ve watched smart, honest people become advocates of ridiculous ideas precisely because of the insidious appeal of being included among the self-designated â€œsmart people.â€ At no point are logic or evidence a significant part of the process. I bring you this sad report after years of trying to persuade with logic and evidence. My record of nearly complete failure should be your warning.</p>

<p>Reciprocation. Reciprocation  explains why free samples can be so effective. People who receive a free, unexpected gift are more likely to listen to a productâ€™s features, donate to a cause, or tip a waitress more money.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Validate the other personâ€™s point of view</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Psychotherapy research shows that when individuals feel listened to, they tend to listen to themselves more carefully and to openly evaluate and clarify their own thoughts and feelings. Lastly, forget about yourself. People frequently make the mistake of pitching ideas that will help them, not the other party. This doesnâ€™t work. Smart people have a very strong firewall for truly embracing an idea. To pass it you must really afford the other party something that they deeply want. Not what you want. That is a secondary goal.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This can only be done by good listening, giving safe space, radical acceptance, and putting yourself in the othersâ€™ shoes.  It can be demonstrated by using their names, summarizing and paraphrasing their point of view, and by remembering little details about them.</p>

<p>Some of the best negotiators are so empathetic that you feel like they feelÂ likeÂ you. They agree with you on everything, or respectfully disagree with you. But they always, always validate you.</p>

<p>Run a simulation. Think to yourself: â€œwhat would I be thinking if I was in that position?â€ To do this well, you must disentangle your own motivations. Take your hat off. Put theirs on. Argue against yourself with them. This helps convey that youâ€™re really trying to see the problem from their side.</p>

<p>Ask questions that start with the words â€œHowâ€ or â€œWhat.â€ By implicitly asking the other party for help, these questions will give your counterpart an illusion of control and will inspire them to speak at length, revealing important information.

    <p><strong>Social Proof.</strong>Â Testimonials from satisfied customers show your target audience that people who are similar to them have enjoyed your product or service. Theyâ€™ll be more likely to become customers themselves. A similar principle applies to television commercials that say: â€œIf our lines are busy, please call again.â€ Instead of saying â€œOperators are standing by.â€ The first response implies that other people like your offer so much that the phone lines are busy, which may persuade others to act similarly.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Get the other side to commit.</strong>Â People want to be both consistent and true to their word. Getting customers or co-workers to publicly commit to something makes them more likely to follow through with an action or a purchase.Â Ask your team members if theyâ€™ll support your next initiative and say why. Getting people to answer â€˜yesâ€™ makes them more powerfully committed to an action.
    <blockquote>
      <p>For instance, donâ€™t tell people: â€œPlease call if you have to cancel.â€ Asking â€œWill you please call if you have to cancel?â€ gets customers to say yes, and measurably increases their response rates.</p>

<p>Every negotiation has two interests: the substantive issue and the relationship.  But they tend to become entangled. Egos get involved, and we draw from comments inferences about the otherâ€™s attitude and intentions about us.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Positional bargaining puts relationships further in conflict with substance. If you make an extreme offer which appears to the other side as unreasonable, theyâ€™d think you do not care about the relationship or them.</li>
  <li>Positonal bargaining deals in negotiators interests by trading off one against the other. The assumption is that the trade-off will work; but it might actually make it worse. When you make concessions, instead of improving the relationship, it might just convince the other person that you can be taken for a ride.</li>
</ul>

<p>By August 1939 Hitler was convinced that the democratic nations would never put up any effective opposition to him. He expressed his contempt for them in a speech he delivered to his Commanders in Chief: â€œOur enemies have leaders who are below the average. No personalities. No masters, no men of actionâ€¦ Our enemies are small fry. I saw them in Munich.â€</p>

<p>â€¨â€¨<strong>Perceptions</strong></p>

<p>Most Conflict lies in peopleâ€™s heads. Fears, however unfounded are real. Hope can launch wars. Facts might do nothing.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Step into their shoes. . Not enough to see the world from their point of view, you must feel it with the full emotional force. It might require you to revise your views, but that is a benefit of the exercise rather than the cost.Tenant vs landlady (rent already too high, rent hasnâ€™t been increases since a longtime. Apartment needs painting, tenant has caused wear and tear, I canâ€™t afford to pay more because other costs are rising, other costs are rising so I need more from rent. I always pay the rent whenever asked, He never pays rent until I ask etc.)</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t deduce their intentions from your fears. It is tempting to see what they say in a dismal light; it is safe. But this has costs: fresh ideas are spurned, and subtle shifts in positions are missed.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t blame them for your problem. Separate symptoms from the person. â€œThe rotor has broken down thrice in the past month. I want your adviceâ€¦Should we change suppliers, sue the manufacturer, or what?â€</li>
  <li>Discuss each others perceptions. Sometimes we ignore concerns which we judge to be unimportant in reaching agreement. Communicate loudly and clearly stuff other side would like to hear (E.g. US on technology transfer, which developing countries wanted to hear on the Law of Open Sea conference)</li>
  <li>Look for opportunities to act inconsistently with their perceptions. e.g. Egyptâ€™s Sadat flew to Jerusalem to show them he is a partner, not adversary</li>
  <li>Give them a stake int the outcome. Ask them for advice. Involve them early. e.g. Ask employees whether they want to take more responsibility before giving it to them. The process matters, also addresses suspicious and fears of the other party, also makes the feel ownership. Give the other side the illusion of Control.   â€œNegotiate in their world. Persuasion is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. Itâ€™s about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea. So donâ€™t beat them with logic or brute force. Ask them questions that open paths to your goals. Itâ€™s not about you.â€Â  Calibrate your questions to point your counterpart toward solving your problem. This will encourage them to expend their energy on devising a solution. Bite your tongue.</li>
  <li>Allow them to save face: make your proposal consistent with your values: so that it appears legitimate to them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Emotions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Recognise and understand emotions, theirs and yours.</li>
  <li>Make emotions explicit and acknowledge them as legitimate</li>
  <li>Let them release emotions. Hear them out</li>
  <li>Have rules to prevent emotional reactions spiralling out of control</li>
  <li>Use symbolic gestures</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>

<p>Three problems in communication</p>
<ul>
  <li>No commincation. You might not be able to communicate</li>
  <li>Not being listened to. If you are communicating, you might not be listened to.</li>
  <li>Misunderstanding. When you are communicating, you might be misinterpreted (â€œI have come here as a mediator to work out a compromise)</li>
</ul>

<p>Solution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Active Listening. Make their case to them better than they did. And then tell them its weaknesses/refute it. Understanding is not agreement. Say â€œLet me see whether I am following what you are telling me from your point of view.â€ â€œAm I correct in saying thatâ€¦â€. Make them spell out what they mean., and request receptions if something is not clear. Listen to understand not respond. It will make them satisfied that they are listened to, and they will also speak more clearly</li>
  <li>Speak to be understood. Think of yourselves as fellow judges solving a case.</li>
  <li>Speak of yourself, not them (If you make a statement against them they do not agree with, they will get defensive and not focus on your concern. But a statement will not provoke a defensive reaction about you they cannot challenge).  â€œI feel let downâ€ vs â€œYou broke your wordâ€, â€œI feel discriminated againstâ€ vs Youâ€™re racistâ€</li>
  <li>Speak for a purpose</li>
</ul>

<p>Prevention works best:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Build a working relationship, even before the negotiation</li>
  <li>Face  he problem, not the people (Helps to literally sit side by side with the people)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="focus-on-interests">Focus on Interests</h2>

<p>Interests define the problem: the basic problem in a negotiation is not position, but hopes, fears, desires, beliefs and concerns that motivate the positions. 
Reconciling interests rather than positions works for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Behind every interest, there are many positions that satisfy it.</li>
  <li>Behind opposed position like many interests. When weighted against these shared, compatible interests, it is easier to manage conflicting interests,</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How do you identity interests?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask Why? Ask Why? Ask if you canâ€™t figure out - but make clear you are not asking for justification, but for an understanding of the needs, hopers, fears, desires.  (â€œWhatâ€™s your basic concern, Mr. Jones, in wanting the lease to run for no more than three years?â€)</li>
  <li>Ask Why Not? Step into their shoes and make a list of the pros/cons of each choice as they see them: what are the political consequences? will I be criticised? What are the economic consequences? Long term/short term? Can i do it later if I want? Will this decision prevent something better? Will it set a good precedent? Is the action consistent with my principles?</li>
  <li>There are more than one interests. There are shared interests besides conflicting interests (e.g a landlord and tenant have shared interests of stability, flat maintenance, and good relationship). Sometimes one makes the mistake of treating the parties on the other side as one and the same.</li>
  <li>Everyone has basic human needs as interests (security, belongingness, recognition, economic well-being, control over oneâ€™s life)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to talk about interests?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Make your interests come alive. Talk about your interests. Be concrete. Establish their legitimacy.</li>
  <li>Acknowledge their interests as part of the problem (â€œIt would be terrible for all of us if one of your trucks hits a childâ€)</li>
  <li>Put the problem before your answer. Give your interests or reasoning first and your conclusions and proposals later. (Otherwise the person has already started making counter arguments before listening to your reasons)</li>
  <li>Look forward, not back. The question â€œWhy?â€ has two meanings: one looks backward at a cause and treats our behaviour as determined by prior events. The other looks forward for a purpose and treats our behaviour as subject of our free will.  You would satisfy your interests better if you would talk about where you want to go instead of where you have come from.</li>
  <li>Be concrete but flexible. Instead of opening positions, do illustrate with specifics. E.g. â€œRs. x is the kind of figure that would satisfy what he is worthâ€.</li>
  <li>Be soft on people, hard on problems. Be firm AND Open.  Emphasize your interests vividly, concretely and combine it with positive support for the other person. Be courteous, appreciate their time and effort, listen with respect and empathise your concern with meeting their basic needs.  This produces cognitive dissonance that then makes the person work with you (separates the problem from the people. â€œ Surely youâ€™re not saying that my sons life is worth less than the price of a fence. You wouldnâ€™t say that about your own so. I do not believe you are an insensitive person. Letâ€™s figure out how to solve the problem). Be open to listening to other personâ€™s interest - only then will they listen t you</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="invent-options-for-mutual-gain">Invent Options for Mutual Gain</h2>

<p>Why we donâ€™t do this?â€¨â€¨</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fear of the other side: disclosing private information of what is acceptable, sending an invitation to what is acceptable, fear of being seen as foolish, or being self-critical with doubts and reservations if youâ€™d be fine.</li>
  <li>Searching for a single answer because we think having a broad spectrum of ideas would delay the process and make it difficult to arrive at a consensus</li>
  <li>Flawed assumption of a fixed pie</li>
  <li>Thinking that solving their problem is their problem: reluctance to give legitimacy to the other sideâ€™s interest.</li>
</ul>

<p>Separate the process of coming up with the options from the process of deciding them. Broaden your options as much as possible. â€¨Consider brainstorming with friends. Improve ideas which are promising. Consider brainstorming with the other side (to make it clear that your ideas are not your offers, make up some clearly ridiculous options. To hide your preference for certain options, bring up two alternatives at the same time). â€¨
To generate options:</p>

<p>Make a circle chart:</p>

<p>Problem: What is the problem?  What are the symptoms? What disliked facts contrasted with a preferred situation?
Analysis: Sort symptoms into categories. List causes. Observe what is lacking. What are the barriers to solution?
Approaches: Theoretical cures. prescriptions or strategies
Action: What can be done? List concrete steps to implement a solution</p>

<p>Look through the eyes of different experts. For example, in a child custody case, how would a nutritionist, a banker, a doctor, a civil rights expert, an educator, a feminist, a psychiatrist, a football coach, a minis etc. would diagnose the problem, what approaches would they suggest?</p>

<p>Invent agreements of different strength, Invent Agreements of different scope</p>

<p>To a prospective editor of your book, you might suggest: â€œHow about editing the first chapter for 300, and weâ€™ll see how it goes?â€</p>

<p>Agreements may be partial, involve fewer parties, cover only selected subject matters, apply only to certain geographic area, or remain in effect only for certain period of time.</p>

<p>Partial vs comprehensive 
provisional vs permanent 
in principal vs final
procedural vs substantive (If a shoe factory cannot agree with a wholesaler on who should pay for a shipment of damaged shoes, perhaps they can agree to submit the issue to the arbiter)
non-binding vs binding
continent vs unconditional
first order vs second order (agree on where you disagree)</p>

<p><strong>Look for mutual gain</strong></p>

<p>Shared interests
It is always a flawed assumption that the pie is fixed, intact , both parties have a shared interest in averting joint loss. 
Identify shared interests: shared interests are usually latent in every negotiation. Ask: do we have a shared interest in preserving the relationship? What oportunitieslie ahead for cooperation and mutual benefit? What costs would we bear if negotiations broke off? Are there common principles that both can respect?
Stress shared interests. Make it explicit and formulate it as an explicit goal.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Situation: a mayor of a town wanted to increase taxes on an oil refinery from $1 million to $2 million
Mayorâ€™s interest: money in the coffers. Improve townâ€™s economy: foster industrial expansion, attract new businesses and create jobs (all of which will bring more money via taxes)
Your interest: refurbish your plant and expand it. have taxes low because the valuation might increase. get a plastics manufacturer to locate nearby to make convenient use of your product. Have taxes low so that the town is attractive to the plastics manufacture .</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shared interest: foster industrial expansion and encourage new industries.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ideas: a tax holiday of seven years for new industries, a joint publicity campaign to attract new companies, a reduction in taxes for existing industries that chose to expand. These would save you money while filling the cityâ€™s coffers</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What to lose if negotiations sour: you cut your contributions to city charities and school athletics. city might become tough in enforcing regulations and ordinances e.g. building odes. relationship might become unpleasant: which outweighs the importance of any particular outcomes</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Situation: if a customer feels cheated in a purchase, your reputation and retention might suffer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Different Interests which can dovetail</p>

<p>Find out what is high benefit to the other person but low cost to you.</p>

<p>Different interests (someone wants an orange fruit and the other one wants the peel to bake):</p>

<p>precedence vs</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different beliefs</li>
  <li>different forecasts</li>
  <li>different aversion to risk</li>
  <li>different value of time</li>
</ul>

<p>Invent different options available and ask for their preference (not acceptance). Then take the preference, work with it a little more, and present two options again. 
e.g. An agent for a player say, would you prefer X amount for 4 years, or Y amount a year for three years? Lets say Y is preferable. Now do you prefer Y,  and 9Y/10 for year years with a Y/2 performance based bonus?</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Make their decision easy</strong></p>

<p>Who is making the decision? Understand that the negotiator on the other side is a human. They have responsibilities that impinge on them.</p>

<p>It is easier to refrain from doing something not being done than to stop action already underway. It is easier to cease doing something than to undertake an entirely new course of action. E.g. if workers want music on the job, it would be easier for the company to not interfere in an experimental employee-run program.</p>

<p>Make the proposal in such a way that appears legitimate to them - be it fair, legal, honourable. Few things facilitate a decision as much as precedents: what the other party has done previously in similar circumstances. Precedents provide an objective standard for your request.</p>

<p><strong>What are their choices?</strong>
Make them aware of the consequences they can expect if they decide as you wish and on improving those consequences from their point of view. What are the specific changes they may like? e.g. Could you let them take credit for coming up with the proposal? Could you let them announce it to the world first? What could you add that would be attractive to them but low cost to yourself?</p>

<p>Could you make their hand stronger within their organization? Could you give them reasons thet would help them persuade others?</p>

<p>Test: Consider how the other side might be criticised if they accepted it. Write a couple of sentences the other sideâ€™s most powerful critic might say. Then write a couple of sentences in defence. 
Test: Could you write a proposition that is realistic, operationable and would make them say â€˜yesâ€™?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="insist-on-objective-criteria">Insist on objective criteria</h2>

<p>e.g. Market value, precedent, scientific judgement (e.g. MITâ€™s economic model of mining), professional standards, efficiency, cost, what a court would decide, moral standards, equal treatment, tradition, reciprocity.</p>

<p>Frame each issue as a joint search for objective criteria. When someone gives an option, ask â€œWhatâ€™s the theory?â€ â€œHow did you arrive at that figure?â€ Treat the problem as though the seller too is looking for a fair option based on objective criteria.</p>

<p>Agree on principles first. Then you can use these principles to persuade. (This makes it easier for them to conceded. Otherwise theyâ€™d be conceding to your criteria - which shows weakness. Conceding to your own principles is an act of strength).</p>

<p>Be reasonable and be open to reason: which standard to choose should not be a contest of will. Be open to listening to other reasons, and look for objective basis to decide between them (precedent or what is widely practiced).</p>

<p>If there is a conflict in criteria: arrive at a middle (e.g. between market value vs depreciated value from initial costs) or (2) insist on someone who you consider to be fair to judge which criteria apply best. Objective criteria are supposed to be legitimate, and legitimacy implies acceptance by a great many people.</p>

<p>Fair procedure:</p>

<p>Never yield to pressure: Pressue can be a bribe, a threat, a manipulative appeal to trust or a refusal to budge. The response should be the same: invite them to state their reasoning, suggest objective criteria you think apply, and refuse to budge except on this basis. Yield only to principle, never to press.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="special-cases">Special Cases</h2>

<p><strong>When they are too powerful</strong></p>

<p>Increase your BATNA
â€œThe firm across the street has offered me 20 percent above what I am now earning. I will rather stay here. But with the cost of living, unless I get a raise soon, I will have to consider moving soon. What do you think might be possible?
â€œThanks for sharing your views and listening to mine. If I decide to go forward, I will get back to you, perhaps with a fresh proposalâ€</p>

<p>Worsen the other sideâ€™s BATNA</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>When they refuse to play</strong></p>

<p>the ideal option would be to circumvent the situation all together by settingÂ  timetables and deadlines at the outset of the negotiation. Make sure the other party understands right off the bat what is expected of him as far as scheduling is concerned.</p>

<p>Let them take a position and evaluate the interests behind the position? Why this position?
When they attack your position, let them.  Dont defend - invite criticism. Examine their underlying interests and to improve your ideas from their point of view. Revise your position based on that.  Ask for advice. What would you do in my situation? 
When they attack you, stay silent. Recast the attack as an attack on the problem.  Ask questions and pause. If they do not give a sufficient answer, stay silent.</p>

<p>Use the one-text procedure: Prepare a draft (by someone neutral) and invite criticisms.  â€œPlease correct me if I am wrongâ€</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please correct me if I am wrong  <br />
We appreciate what youâ€™re done for us  <br />
Our concern is fairness  <br />
We would like to settle this on the basis of independent standards, not of who can do what to whom <br />
Trust is a separate issue  <br />
Could I ask you a few questions to see whether my facts are right?  <br />
Whatâ€™s the principle behind your action?  <br />
Let me see if I understand what youâ€™re saying  <br />
Let me get back to you  <br />
Let me show you where I have trouble following some of your reasoning  <br />
One fair solution might beâ€¦  <br />
if we agree â€¦ and if we disagreeâ€¦  <br />
Weâ€™d be happy to see if we can leave when itâ€™s most convenient for you  <br />
Itâ€™s been a pleasure dealing with you</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Hostile Situations</strong></p>

<p><em>Principled Negotiation Approach</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Truly listen, recognise the emotion, and reframe it in a way that gives you an opportunity to explain.</p>

    <p>Compare</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I hear your concern. Thereâ€™s a lot of passion</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>with:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Youâ€™re angry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When they answer, â€œNo Iâ€™m frustrated!â€, answer it in your frame.</p>

<p><em>Evasive Approach</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Parry aggression with indirect engagement: â€œGive a man enough rope and heâ€™ll hang himself with it.â€
THEY feel as though they are strengthening their position, but in fact, they are just showing you their hand.â€</li>
</ul>

<p>Youâ€™re in a verbal fight. What you need is. The Fabian strategy is a brilliant tactic whereby open combat is explicitly avoided in favor of evasion. In this way, as your opponent uses a large amount of energy to muster an attack, you use a small amount of energy to maneuver out of its way.Â When someone first becomes incensed at the start of an argument, they are strong. Anything you say to contravene their view will only fuel their anger, further entangling you into battle. Avoid engaging them head-to-head: Retreat, give them ground, and face them again from a safe distance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Them: â€œYo youâ€™re at MY table! Iâ€™m meeting my friends later and this is where we always sit! If you donâ€™t move Iâ€™m gonna kick your ass!â€ <br />
You (BAD): â€œWell the bar is rather full and I was here first, soâ€¦â€ <br />
You: (GOOD): â€œOh, I genuinely didnâ€™t knowâ€¦ This is your table, so I guess youâ€™re a regular here?â€</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>What youâ€™ve done is youâ€™ve baited them into throwing their aggressive inertia at nothing. Theyâ€™re happy to go on and on about their point, but now their focus is on themselves and not you.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Them: â€œYeah we come here like every Wednesday for the cheap wings. 10 cents is a steal, yo! And we ALWAYS sit here so you gotta move!â€ <br />
You: â€œOh wow, I didnâ€™t even know about the wing dealâ€“ Thanks for telling me about that! How did you guys come to choose this table?â€</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>You see, each round of conversation, they put another card on the table. THEY feel as though they are strengthening their position, but in fact, they are just showing you their hand.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Them: â€œWe justâ€¦ I mean weâ€™ve just like always sat here!â€<br />
You: â€œYeah, I totally understand! You guys have been coming here for awhile then?â€    <br />
Them: â€œYeah for like 6 months!â€  <br />
You: â€œThatâ€™s cool, man. So youâ€™re like friends with all the bartenders and stuff.â€  <br />
Them: â€œNah not really, but like they probably recognize us I guess.â€ <br />
You: â€œOh definitely. Iâ€™ve worked at a few barsâ€¦ We always recognize the regulars, even if we donâ€™t know them by name.â€  <br />
Them: â€œOh which bars did you work at?â€</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Notice how avoiding direct engagement of their point of conflict (â€œYouâ€™re sitting at our tableâ€) and letting them speak causes the interaction to cool off? Theyâ€™ve played all of their cards, and seeing their whole argument laid out on the table in this way is very disarming. Watch their anger fizzle, and their argument unravel.</li>
  <li>Once their aggression has subsided (it always does), you can revisit the topic rationally and with rapport. Many arguments donâ€™t even warrant revisiting the main topic, but in our example, you would still need to decide who gets to keep the table. Once youâ€™ve de-escalated the argument though, thatâ€™s much easier to do.</li>

<p><strong>Deception</strong></p>

<p>Examples of me using it:</p>

<p>Examples of me facing it:</p>

<p>What should be done:
Ask the other party probing questions to find out what they did for the other companies. What terms did they agree to? How large was their order? Get as many details as possible about what theyâ€™ve done for them in the past.
Never trust. â€œIf I told you I have money in my bank account and Iâ€™d pay you laterâ€, would you sell me the item based on trust? Itâ€™s not about trust.â€</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Dubious Intentions</strong></p>

<p>Examples of me using it:</p>

<p>Examples of me facing it:</p>

<p>What should be done:

â€œAre you certain your client will pay?â€
â€œOf courseâ€
â€œA hundred percent certain?â€
â€œYes, I am a hundred percent certainâ€
â€œThen you wonâ€™t mind a contingent agreement. Your client will pay for child support. If, for some inexplicable reason which you estimate at 0% probability, he misses two payments, my client will get equity in the houseâ€</p>

Examples of me facing it:
What should be done:
The keys to countering this tactic are finding out who makes decisions and arranging a way to meet with them. It is important, when possible, to start negotiating with the individual who has final authority in order to prevent this tactic from being used. Try to find out what standards are used to determine whether an agreement will be authorized or not. Prior to negotiating, attempt to find out who makes final decisions regarding delivery times, price, payment terms, etc. You can also ask to set up a meeting with that person if the other party attempts to use this tactic.  Get them to agree in principle, if possible in writing, and then talk to the hardhearted partner. â€œItâ€™s a perfectly reasonable request, I agree, but my wife refuses to go along with itâ€.</p>

<p>Insist on reciprocity â€œAlright, we will treat this as a joint draft to which neither side is committed. You discuss with your boss and I will see if I want any changes which I would suggest tomorrowâ€</p>

<p><strong>Threats</strong></p>

<p>Examples of me using it:
Buying pants for Manan in Iceland</p>

<p>Examples of me facing it:</p>

<p>What should be done:</p>

<p>Threats require credible communication, so if you could interfere with that: ignore it, treat it as if spoken in haste, or spoken with unauthorised authority. Best: make it risky to communicate threats. â€œYour voice is being recorded. What number are you calling?â€
Warnings are much more legitimate than threats. â€œShould we fail to reach the agreement, it seems highly probable to me that the news media would insist on publishing the whole sordid story. In a matter of this much public interest, I donâ€™t see how we could suppress information.â€</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first time Steve Jobs fired Andrea Cunningham, he called her into his conference room where he was seated with his â€œCFOâ€ and told Andrea Cunningham â€œIâ€™m going to cut off my contract with you. I think the work youâ€™re doing is terrible and weâ€™re just going to stop it right now so thatâ€™s it, youâ€™re fired.â€
He owed her $35,000 for her services which When Andy Cunningham demanded, Steve Jobs wasnâ€™t ready to pay because he believed her work wasnâ€™t worth it. So after being declined the payment, Andrea Cunningham called up her Mentor (Regis McKenna) and complained about Steve Jobs not paying her The money he owes her to which her mentor (Regis McKenna) replies â€œWell, if you want to get paid by Steve Jobs youâ€™re going to have to have something over him.â€
At that point Cunningham was confused and didnâ€™t understand what Regis McKenna meant, Regis McKenna later cleared the doubt by Letting her know her contacts with the business press was her upper hand against Steve Jobs. She goes back to Steve Jobs and demands her 35000$ later to which Steve Jobs replies â€œWhy?â€
She answers with â€œWell, just so you know Steve I get about 30 or 40 phone calls a week from the business press that weâ€™ve made relationships over the last couple of years asking me what kind of a guy you are to work with and I currently tell them very nice things.â€
After hearing this Steve Jobs Writes her a check and hires her Back Immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Refusal to Negotiate</strong></p>

<p>Examples: Iran during the hostage crisis, Palestinians,</p>

<p>Examples of me using it:</p>

<p>Examples of me facing it:</p>

<p>What should be done:
Involve third parties, or write letters. Insist on asking principles and reciprocity â€œIs this how you would expect us to play when its your turn? Or others to play with them? What principles apply in this situation?â€</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Extreme Demand</strong></p>

<p>What should be done:
Bring it up, ask for the principle and make them look ridiculous to themselves.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Escalating Demand</strong></p>

<p>Raising a demand for every concession they make. Reopen issues which you thought were closed.</p>

<p>Examples: Hitler building the German Navy and U-boats in violation of Versailles (35),  remilitarisation of Rhineland (36) in violation of Versailles,  Anschluss, Munich agreement for Sudentenland, then whole of Czechoslovakia (despite the Munich Agreement) before invading Poland and World War 1.
The proper lesson of Munich is not â€” as so often misinterpreted â€” that we should avoid haggling with tyrants. The world will get along much better when modern Western leaders accept the necessity of cutting deals with Russiaâ€™s thuggish President Putin and Chinaâ€™s brutal President Xi.
But we need to recognise that there is no chance of persuading such people to keep their word or respect our vital interests, unless we possess the armed forces to defend them by force, if necessary.</p>

<p>Examples of me using it:</p>

<p>Examples of me facing it:
KRA asking for apologies in writing again and again from mom. 
Mobile phone repair in Vyaapar Kendra.</p>

<p>What should be done:
Recognise this tactic, Take a break and evaluate the situation. Insist on principle</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Lockin Tactics</strong></p>

<p>Examples: The chicken game where one of the drivers throws out its break and steering wheel.</p>

<p>What should be done:
Depends on communication. Intepret it as a weak signal. 
â€œOh, so you went to the press and told them youâ€™d not settle for less than X. We all have aspirations. Mine areâ€¦â€
â€œAlright Bobâ€¦ I understand you went public withâ€¦But my practice is to never yield to pressure, only to reasonâ€.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Delaying Tactic</strong></p>

<p>It can be used to inspire uneasiness and doubt in the other party, or for buying time for additional research or  internal discussion</p>

<p>Examples of me using it:
Negotiating Jugnoo salary.</p>

<p>Examples of me facing it:
What should be done:
Look for objective conditions that can be used to establish deadlines.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Take it or Leave it</strong></p>

<p>Examples of me using it:
Examples of me facing it: Harmilap Nagar out-of-court settlement
What should be done:  Ignore it. Change the subject, introduce other options. Or remind them what they have to lose by saying no, and present a face-saving way for them to get out of the situation.  e.g. If the management makes a final offer, say â€œX was your final offer BEFORE we discussed our cooperative efforts to make the plant more productiveâ€.</p>

<h1 id="negotiation-microtactics">Negotiation Microtactics</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Donâ€™t talk too much, refrain from baring all</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Be silent until they talk. Nobody likes an uncomfortable silence. Be silent for as long as it takes for them to talk again. Let it be uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>Look at people while youâ€™re talking to them. If their faces change, consider what you just said and ask them what they think about it. Then remain silent while they answer. In a number of fields, especially negotiation, a common adage is â€œThe one who speaks first loses.â€</li>
      <li>Only a silent observer can track the flow of topics and reactions reliably. If you really need to determine whether someone is lying, work with a partner: one person talks, the other just watches the subject.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=107&amp;v=V7OtklcPITs">Comic Relief Does The Apprentice part 2</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Set the tone</strong>. Donâ€™t make things that arenâ€™t a big deal a huge deal. (Donâ€™t be like â€œWe need to talkâ€ for something small and frivolous â€œhey just want to talk to you for a bit).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Set the pace.</strong> When the other person is in a hurry to close a deal then I will delay. When theyâ€™re not in a hurry then Iâ€™ll create a sense of urgency in them and then will delay a bit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before you head into the weeds of bargaining, youâ€™ll need a plan of extreme anchor, calibrated questions, and well-defined offers. Remember: 65, 85, 95, 100 percent. Decreasing raises and ending on nonround numbers will get your counterpart to believe that heâ€™s squeezing you for all youâ€™re worth when youâ€™re really getting to the number you want.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Show People that its in their interest</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The price I am willing to sell it at would not be attractive to you</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Point at what all is going to be lost if this falls. Making people hostage to the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Anchoring.</strong>
  AnchoringÂ with an extreme offer:Â Â you will not only influence the negotiation, but also actually change the other sideâ€™s beliefs about the nature of an appropriate agreement.
    <blockquote>
      <p>I want to buy something, and a fair price is $2,000, the offer price is $2,400. Iâ€™ll go in and make a semi-joke that I want to buy it for $300 (not a typo), and mention that figure repeatedly, with a big smile to keep it friendly. Suddenly even $1,600 suddenly seems reasonable because itâ€™s being compared to with the joke $300. And Iâ€™ll offer $1,400, and at least go for $1,600.</p>

      <p>If youâ€™re on $5k per month, tell your boss, as a joke, that you should be on $20k for all the work you do - mention it a few times, with a smile every time. Now, ask for a $1k pay rise - sounds like peanuts.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pretending to take the deal off.</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I did this when selling life insurance. He would say something like, â€œOh, I see that there is some history of heart disease in you family.â€ He would say this while closing his folder and sitting back in his chair as if done. He would then tell them that he may not be able to help them after all. That is when the customer would all of a sudden start proving their qualifications for the insurance and describing how healthy they are. They would almost be begging to be signed up.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Compare with favourible instances to useÂ availability bias.</strong> the tendency to rely on readily available information. By carefully choosing comparisons to the current situation, you can persuade the other party about the appropriate settlement. In a legal context, when defendants can cite similar cases where a judicial award was very small, they sometimes can influence the judgeâ€™s or juryâ€™s assessment of the value of the case.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Frame options which makes your preferred deal look attractive</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, rather than making a flat offer of $30,000 to settle a case, a defendant could offer a choice among $30,000 immediately, $10,000 annually for the next three years, or a $30,000 payment to charity. When compared with the other two options, the $30,000 cash offer is likely to appear more attractive than when it is the only offer on the table. A negotiator may very well compare the options offered rather than comparing the $30,000 to the option of holding out for more money.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mirror: pause and repeat.</strong> 
Great in getting a cheap Bargain.Â â€¨It gives you time. If they elaborate and explain, it gives you a good idea on their position: whether it is soft or stable.  Ask someone, â€œWhat do you mean by that?â€ and youâ€™re likely to incite irritation or defensiveness. A mirror, however, will get you the clarity you want while signaling respect and concern for what the other person is saying. â€œYesâ€.
    <blockquote>
      <p>If they say, â€œWe will offer $100,000 but canâ€™t go a penny higherâ€ repeat back to them, â€œyou canâ€™t go a penny higher. â€â€¨â€¨They will continue talking.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Use power words like â€œbecauseâ€</strong> They amp up emotions and trigger curiosity. Basically you could be asking the same thing but the way you package it could make all the difference. Here is an example I found in Influence by Robert B. Cialdini that really backs this up. In a research experiment done by a social psychologist she received a different number of approvals depending on how she delivered her request:
    <blockquote>
      <p>â€œExcuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine?â€ â€“ 60% said OK
â€œExcuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because Iâ€™m in a rush?â€ â€“ 94% said OK</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Stock Phrases</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œHave you ever made an exception?â€  <br />
â€œHow you know that you made a right choice?â€  <br />
 â€œThere is no other wayâ€ (with a downward inflection)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="case-study-venture-capitalists">Case Study: Venture Capitalists</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A lot of the reason VCs are harsh when negotiating with startups is that theyâ€™re embarrassed to go back to their partners looking like they got beaten. When they sign a termsheet, they want to be able to brag about the good terms they got. A lot of them donâ€™t care that much personally about whether founders keep board control. They just donâ€™t want to seem like they had to make concessions. Which means if letting the founders keep control stops being perceived as a concession, it will rapidly become much more common. You can spell this out, and say â€œdonâ€™t think of the battle. Think of the war. Think of your long term investment, i.e. the success of the company and what is best for itâ€</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="case-study-salary-negotiation">Case Study: Salary Negotiation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use Round Numbers
Assuming youâ€™ve done your homework on whatÂ industryÂ standards are and what value you bring and how much you think you should be making, itâ€™s ok to start with a salary number. But donâ€™t say $100,000. Say, $103,500. Something specific. This shows youâ€™ve done the work. Make sure you can back it up to get to that number. Round numbers are negotiated. Specific numbers, backed up by evidence, are not negotiated.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few general principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is VERY hard to advocate for yourself or talk about money, especially if you donâ€™t come from money. Please, please: Do it anyway. You are valuable to your employer. Anybody can be replaced, but doing so is expensive and disruptive. They want to keep you. If theyâ€™re offering to hire you, they probably had a long job search process and really want it to come to a satisfactory conclusion for all of you, YOU included.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is ALWAYS more money. If you get a job offer, thank them (profusely is fine), ask to get details of the offer in writing (itâ€™s hard to think clearly about dental plans during a high-stakes conversation), and say you will get back to them soon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Do not accept any offer immediately, no matter how great it sounds. The best negotiation I ever had was when I said, â€œlet me think about itâ€. And then waiting. And really thinking about it. Making my list. Doing due diligence. Really thinking if there are other offers. Or potential offers.
  Your value on the job market works like value on every other market: supply and demand. Really determine what the supply is for your services and if you can potentially be in demand.
  When you first get interest in being made an offer, you have to determine immediately what the supply is. If supply is zero, you put yourself in a bad position.
  But regardless, you can act like supply is great by being patient and saying first, â€œLet me go over all of this. Itâ€™s a lot to take in. Iâ€™m really grateful for the offer. How about we talk in a day or so.â€Â 
  Trust me: this is a scary thing to say but it has worked for me at least three different times and I was scared to death each time.
  If you are offered a job in the morning, say,
    <blockquote>
      <p>â€œThis is great. Let me go over it and figure outÂ logisticsÂ and family issues and call you back later.â€ 
  Then SLEEP. Then call back as late in the day as possible to negotiate.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Talk to people about the offer. Itâ€™s awkward to talk about money, but ask people with experience in your industry if they would be willing to help you evaluate the offer. It doesnâ€™t have to be a close friend, just someone you respect. Itâ€™s flattering and interesting to be asked for career advice, and most people are happy to give it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Asymmetrical information depresses wages and keeps people stuck in unhappy jobs. To negotiate an offer, say you admire the work and mission of your potential employer and would love to work there, but your only hesitation is the compensation package. Then itâ€™s up to them. There is more money, and they will find it for you. If it doesnâ€™t seem like enough more money, say that youâ€™re very grateful for the new offer but would like to know if itâ€™s possible to go higher. Remind them of your dedication and enthusiasm for the job.</p>
  </li>
  <li>You donâ€™t need to have a reason why you need a higher salary (you donâ€™t have to say youâ€™re paying off student loans, for instance). BUT, if you are changing jobs and this would be a salary cut, you can let them know that.
In some cases a salary cut is the right thing to do â€“ if you would have more autonomy or potential for career advancement or just plain more FUN at the new position, take the salary cut if you can afford it. (I did so once and it was the absolute right decision.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Make them see your point of view and give them the illusion of control:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œIf you were me being offered this job, what would you ask for?â€</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œYou guys are the experts on how one can grow and flourish and bring the most value to your company. What should I ask for and how do you see me growing in the company? Can we outline that out?â€</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œBecause I like this company a lot and want to accept this, I trust that you will help me figure out the right things to ask for here. Is there anything Iâ€™m missing?â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People Donâ€™t Ask â€œHow?â€</p>

<p>If they offer too little or no moving expenses or no vacation or no path to promotion, simply ask: â€œHow?â€.</p>

<p>Insist on objective criteria:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Other people in the industry are making $X. I know that I offer $Y in value. Can you walk me through how I can accept $Z that you are offering?â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They will keep talking and the numbers will change. Trust me on this.</p>

<p>If you ask for something and they say, â€œWe canâ€™t. This is HR guidelinesâ€. Say,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>â€œHmmm, are you guys powerless to do anything about this?â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody wants to feel powerless. They will make changes or work this through HR.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If your potential new employer says they donâ€™t have more money and explains WHY â€“ maybe theyâ€™re small or have a narrow pay band or whatever â€“ that establishes that they are being honest and open with you, which is itself a job benefit. You want to work with people you trust.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may be able to negotiate other things rather than pay â€“ working remotely, more vacation, career development, etc. Itâ€™s not all about the money.
But it IS ALSO ABOUT THE MONEY. And it is right and good and proper for you to ask for more money.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Okay, so, if youâ€™re in a job and want a raise or promotion, keep a Brag Book. Write down everything youâ€™ve done, even minor stuff, that was a success or helped your employer or other employees or showed initiative or made money or added to your employerâ€™s reach or prestige.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do NOT assume your boss knows about your achievements. Bosses are idiots much of the time. (I am a boss, I am often an idiot.) During performance reviews and especially when youâ€™re asking for a raise, list specific examples of your contributions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If youâ€™re asking for a promotion â€“ and really, isnâ€™t it time you got a promotion? â€“ highlight how what youâ€™ve been doing goes beyond your current job description and is work that is often done by people in X other (higher-paid) positions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are difficult discussions. Print out your Brag Book list to help you remember things. If you get flustered, itâ€™s fine to ask to continue the conversation later, or ask for a moment to collect your thoughts. Or offer to send your request in writing.
Even if you donâ€™t get a raise or promotion this time, it tells your boss that you expect to be recognized for your work. Itâ€™s a process. Asking for more doesnâ€™t make you look greedy, it makes you look ambitious and eager for new opportunities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Itâ€™s not just about money. Think of every aspect in a situation. Everything you would like. Then you can give up the nickels for the dimes if your list is longer .Â For instance, one side might just be negotiating salary. But the other side could be negotiating salary, title, insurance, vacation, promotion standards, outside work, etc. The longer list always wins.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

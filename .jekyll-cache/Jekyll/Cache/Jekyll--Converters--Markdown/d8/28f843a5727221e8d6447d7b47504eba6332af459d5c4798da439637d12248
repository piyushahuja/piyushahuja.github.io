I"<p>34 this month. It’s time to take stock.</p>

<p>This juncture of life feels crucial in a way others weren’t. It feels as if I am at a crucial bend in the road, and if I don’t maneuver it well, I could be permanenly thrown off track, derailed, in many important areas of life: career, relationships, and family.  I am already late, but not too late, and this feels like a last chance to course correct.</p>

<p><strong>A Retrospective</strong></p>

<p>Years ago, at 25, I had created a wishlist of six goals for myself: to strengthen my body, to sharpen my wit, to become proficient in programming, to inculcate an ability to lead, to learn life saving skills, and to write a novel (the last of these was for retirement).</p>

<p>Looking back, it is quite revealing that the five of six of those centred around personal development. If I am really honest with myself, the primary drive that motivated those was to get rid of a fundamental feeling of discontent with my who I was - a persistent, lingering feeling that I was aware of yet found hard to dispel. These concerns (to be fit, competent, and demonstrate community leadership) can also been seen as anxious preoccupations of a young man growing into his masculinity.</p>

<p>If I were to honestly assess myself on these ten years on, I did clear the bar on at least four of those. I became fit to the extent that people would compliment me on my fitness unprompted (or object to me calling myself overweight). The most beautiful girl in my meditation retreat referred to me as the funniest person in the group. As a product manager and, later an entrepreneur, I learnt to recruit and lead product teams, deliver products, and present talks at gatherings that were well-received.  The programming path took me to the level of senior software engineer.  As for the fifth: while I learnt first-aid, cooking fundamentals, and how to build a campfire, those skills still need practice and leave much room for improvement.</p>

<p>At 30, my desires had morphed primarily to three: to build a company, to write a novel (post-retirement), and to have my own happy family.  At 32, I bought my first home (it now fetches £20k in annual rent).  At 33, following a competitive £15k grant win, I started a company. Over the course of the year, I developed an extensive network in India, UK, and US, recruited a friend and hired some interns, and attracted and fulfilled a £34k+ contract.  Over all this time, the romantic idea of writing a novel has lost its charm, and I can now see myself joining a company rather than building my own. The desire for a family remains.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>So, what are my immediate priorities at 34?</strong></p>

<p>First, I want to build a family with a life partner I love and respect, a family home that is big enough to host my parents, and where I’d bring up my children.</p>

<p>Second, I want a job that engages my best capabilities with smart coworkers I enjoy working with, that earns me enough money for quality childcare, education, leisure pursuits, and affords me ample flexibility to be present for my family.</p>

<p>Third, I want to embody and sustain a spiritual, feel-good, healthy masculine energy. I want to feel that feeling of gratitude again, where I would feel extraordinarily lucky, good things and people start coming in my life, I become extraordinarily productive, and I find beauty in everything and experience the joy of living.</p>

<p><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></p>

<p>I need to decide where to live and work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>UK</li>
  <li>India</li>
  <li>US</li>
</ul>

<p>I need to decide what to work on and how:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leetcode + System Design -&gt; Google/Meta</li>
  <li>AI/ML Stack -&gt; Unambitious London company like Blackrock, etc.</li>
  <li>Platonia</li>
  <li>A mixture: Law with Riina, AI Moderator with Tue,</li>
  <li>A New Stack (Robotics)</li>
</ul>

<p>What am I looking for in a life partner?</p>

<p>Time is against me.</p>

<p>One big challenge would be the health of mom.</p>

<p>The other would be fertility.</p>

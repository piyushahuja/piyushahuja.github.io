I"(<p>There are many different ways in which an ontological theory can be criticised. It can be called metaphysically extravagant, unintuitive, or unsupported and unsuggested by empirical findings, or, more damagingly - incoherent and inconsistent.    With regards to presentism, the greatest challenge comes from the empirical support for Special Theory of Relativity - a theory which, at least on the face of it,  seems to be ontologically committed to the denial of presentism. I will confess - I do not have a sufficient understanding of the special theory of relativity to see exactly how it renders presentism false.  Nor do I need to. For my present concern is the absurdity of presentism, not its truth or falsity. Specifically,  my charge here is that the theory of presentism is absurd regardless of the other criticisms it might possess. In light of its absurdity, one would need a stronger defence of presentism than what is required for other positions. If anything, the special theory of relativity doesn’t help its case. </p>

No thought you can think 
That encompasses the Great Self

Your essence
is immortal and unchanging
Yet it is the foundations for all that moves

Rest in the shimmering emptiness
That is the source of the world
And remember who you are

<p>I have to be somewhere, where I desire something.<sup id="fnref:event" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:event" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> To get it, or to manage the anxiety, I have to be someone - a certain way. So the thought goes.</p>

<p>I could be :</p>

<ul>
  <li>spiritual, like a stoic monk.</li>
  <li>generous and giving, as if I were in service.</li>
  <li>a coach or a mentor, full of discernment and life lessons</li>
  <li>follow rules of behavior: about yes/no, needs, wants and boundaries. the ‚Äúright‚Äù way to be, the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing to say</li>
  <li>Nice Guy</li>
  <li>speak slowly, clearly, lovingly and positively</li>
  <li>outspoken and attention-seeking.</li>
  <li>‚Äúin my power‚Äù: outspoken and status seeking, as a way of channeling eros.</li>
  <li>playful and humorous, as it provides comfort, flexibility and makes others feel safe.</li>
  <li>try and focus on externals: as in the improv exercise, as a way of maintaing presence.</li>
  <li>create fun</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>The way to be is to be self-aware to yourself. What are you noticing, within and outside?  What thoughts are arising? What feelings? What are you noticing in the realm of energy?</p>

<p>This is no easy practice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>stay attuned to my own inner (thoughts, feelings) experience</li>
  <li>stay attuned to your outer experience: listening to others on a feeling and energy level and responding , reading the room and the energy in the room, noticing details</li>
  <li>seek the touch of the beloved in every moment‚Äôs happening: make love to every moment</li>
</ul>

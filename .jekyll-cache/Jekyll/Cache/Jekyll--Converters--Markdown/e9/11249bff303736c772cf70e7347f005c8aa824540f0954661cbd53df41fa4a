  <li>Is your authentic self something you were born with and you need to fulfill (an essential self), or is it something you create for yourself throughout your life (an existential self)?
    <ul>
      <li>The call of personal authenticity — of being true to one’s self — conceals the chasms between the essential self and the existential self, which are psychologically divergent interpretations of the Self. Existentialist authenticity prescribes to the individual man and woman “determine your destiny!”, by being aware of the absolute freedom to choose.</li>
      <li>Essentialist authenticity demands that a person find and follow a prescribed system of values in order to reach a pre-ordained destiny.</li>
      <li>The essentialist person searches for signs of self-betrayal; the existentialist person asks: “How am I not myself?” and answers “Only when I act in bad faith”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Does your obligation to be true to yourself override your obligations to others?
    <ul>
      <li>In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which a person’s actions are congruent with his or her values and desires, despite external pressures to social conformity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Where does authenticity end and narcissism start? Modern western capitalist fetish with individualism, excessive idea of self-importance, outward-focussed.
    <ul>
      <li>We are both defined by certain factors over which we have no control but we also have freedom to interpret and expand our situation. We can make ourselves but we dont have complete control over our self making. Factic “I have no control” vs the other extreme “I can create myself anew out of nothing”. The task at hand that we are both factic and free.</li>
      <li>Authenticity is the opposite of narcissism. We are tempted to reify the idea of self to reduce our freedom rather than expand it. Narcissism is dependent on the idea of the self, authenticity is the idea of the self.  (Sartre)</li>
      <li>Judge for yourself but that does not mean self-welfare.</li>
    </ul>

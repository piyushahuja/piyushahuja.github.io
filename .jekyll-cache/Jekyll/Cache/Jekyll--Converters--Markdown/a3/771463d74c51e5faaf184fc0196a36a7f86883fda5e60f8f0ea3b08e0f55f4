<!-- My long-term project, [Platonia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.platonialabs.platonia), can now be downloaded on Google playstore. One of the best way to learn is to teach it to someone. Platonia allows you to organize one-on-one meetups with people near you for learning-and-teaching. -->
<p><strong>Education</strong></p>

<p>I read for a second BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford.  I was supported by the KC Mahindra Scholarship, <a href="https://www.tiarafoundation.com/copy-of-tiara-special-grant">Tiara Special Grant</a>, and a second undergraduate degree scholarship by Harris Manchester College.</p>

<p>Before Oxford, I graduated from IIT Delhi with a five-year Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Computing in 2013. My masterâ€™s thesis was in the design of approximation algorithms for networks under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen_Garg">Naveen Garg</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I enjoy learning, teaching, and creative collaborations.</strong></p>

<!-- - **Teaching:**  I am interested in teaching or mentoring opportunies in philosophy, algorithms, and creative writing.

- **Learning:** I am looking for people interested in practicing Improv, First Aid, or Wilderness survival skills.  

- **Creative Collaborations:** If you'd like to collaborate on something for *fun*, please don't hesitate to reach out. Here are some ideas: a podcast, a comedy sketch, a mobile app, or any long-form writing assignment.

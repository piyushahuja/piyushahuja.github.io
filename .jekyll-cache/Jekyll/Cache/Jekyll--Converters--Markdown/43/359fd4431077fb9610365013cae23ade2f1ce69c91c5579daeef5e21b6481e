I"ï <p>Is causation analyzable in terms of counterfactuals?</p>

<p>Causation, for the purpose of this essay, is taken to be aÂ relation between events. (One might alternatively define causation where theÂ relata are framed as facts, or states of affairs, or an agent and an event.Â That analysis then would differ, althoughÂ there are strong arguments against the use of some of these, e.g. Davidsonâ€™s slingshot argument against fact causation). Counterfactuals, to counterfactual conditionals, are statements of the formÂ â€˜If it had been the case that p, then it would have been the caseÂ thatÂ qâ€™Â - where the antecedent expresses something that is â€˜contrary to factâ€™, or what isÂ actuallyÂ the case, and theÂ auxiliary verbsÂ appearing in the antecedent and the consequent are subjunctive in mood. Â An analyses ofÂ causation in terms of counterfactuals would trace the meanings of the statements of causation, likeÂ â€˜Event c was a cause of event eâ€™, Â to counterfactualÂ conditionalsÂ of the formÂ â€˜If c had not happened, then e would not have happenedâ€™ (Here,Â c and e are shorthands for cause and effect).</p>

<p>The simplest analysisÂ analysis through counterfactuals would be :</p>

<p>Event c was a cause of event e if and only if c occurred and e occurred and if cÂ had not occurred, then e would not have occurred.</p>

<p>However, such a simple analysis would allowÂ an event to be its own cause, since it might be the case, by way of such anÂ analysis, that c is a cause of e AND e is a cause of c. For if c and e are such events that always go together, like moving my arm and moving my elbow for example, then it would always be the case that e would not haveÂ occurred had c not occurred and vice versa. Even if we refine the analysis to include only wholly distinct events, there would be other problems.Â Some of them are described below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In a case of actual overdetermination, e has another actual cause, d, in addition to c, such that, even if c had not occurred, d would still have occurred and would still have caused e.Â For example, take the the case of twoÂ assassinsÂ shooting at a target, where c is Assassin Câ€™s bullet, d isÂ Assassin Dâ€™s bullet, and e is the death of the target. Â AlthoughÂ Assassin Câ€™s (andÂ AssassinÂ Dâ€™s) bullet causes the death in the actual world, the counterfactual analysis suggests it doesnâ€™t, as the death would have occurredÂ even if Câ€™s bullet hadnâ€™t been fired.</li>
  <li>In a case of pre-emption, another event, d, occurs, such that although d is not actually a cause of e, if c had notÂ occurred, then d would still haveÂ occurred and would then have caused e. Here again,Â Assassin Câ€™s bullet, and not Dâ€™s,Â causes the death in the actual world, while the counterfactual analysis suggests it doesnâ€™t, as the death would have occurredÂ even if Câ€™s bullet hadnâ€™t been fired.</li>
  <li>In a fail safe case, if c had notÂ occurred, then another event, dÂ - which did not actually occurÂ -Â would haveÂ occurred and would then have caused e. The counterfactual analysis fails to capture it parallel to the above cases.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will grant that the above problems do not prove that a counterfactual analysis of causation is not possibleÂ - butÂ onlyÂ that the simple analysis given above wouldnâ€™t do the job. It can be arguedÂ that although the above analysis is mistaken, there might be some analysis similarly based on counterfactuals which is so refined that all problematic cases are excludedÂ and taken care of. But the above example at least show that,Â even if there is the possibility of a counterfactual analyses of causation,Â  such an account would have to be at least a bit involved andÂ sophisticated.</p>

<p>However, my contention here is stronger:Â  I believe that anyÂ analysis of causation based on counterfactuals is off the rail from the start.Â This is becauseÂ theÂ evaluation of truth and falsity ofÂ counterfactualÂ conditionals does not satisfy at least two constraints which we might reasonably require of any analyses of causal relations: (1) itÂ should not be circular, i.e. the analyses shouldÂ notÂ rely on causal considerations themselves and (2) itÂ should represent causality as an objective relation which obtains between itsÂ relate independent of how humans choose to describe or frame those entities.Â Both these criticisms are founded on the way we interpret and evaluate counterfactual conditionals. Let me take them one by one.</p>

<p>For counterfactuals to provide a valid basis for the meaning ofÂ causation, itÂ is imperative that the counterfactuals, in turn, do notÂ derive their meaning from causation itself. The meaning of a statement of the formÂ  â€˜If c had not happened, then e would not have happenedâ€™Â is not as straightforward as a statement like, say,Â â€˜Everyime c happens, e happensâ€™, because while the latter is a statement ofÂ observation about the world, the former seems to point out to an alternative reality.Â </p>

<p>The most common way of interpreting a counterfactual is by an appeal to the notion of possible worlds. A counterfactual conditional of the form â€˜If it had been the case that p, then it would have been the case that qâ€™ is interpreted as a statement about a world which is fairly similar to the actual worldÂ except where p is true. However, whether the statement is true or not depends on which causal propositions are true in this alternative but close-to-actualÂ world. For example, whether the statementÂ â€˜If I had let go off the stone, it would have fallen to the groundâ€™Â is true or not will depend, in part, on whatÂ causal matters of fact or causal laws are true in this alternative worldÂ - whether the stone is supported by a thread, whether there is person ready to catch the stone, whether the gravitational law holds, and so forth. To assess the truth or falsity of counterfactual conditionals, then, we need a notion of causation in the first place.Â </p>

<p>It might be argued that we need causation to evaluate a counterfactual proposition Â asÂ true ofÂ falseÂ does not imply we need causation to interpret its meaningÂ viaÂ the notion of possible worlds. Â Yet can we really understand a proposition yet not have any idea of what it means for it to be true or false?Â - which would be true for a person who does not graspÂ the concept of causation in the first place. UnlessÂ we get an alternative account for the meaning of counterfactual conditions which does not require the concept of causation, the circularity objection would hold.</p>

<p>There are other reasons to suspect thatÂ an analysis of causation based on counterfactuals is misguided. This is Â because the truth value of aÂ counterfactuals is highly contextÂ dependent, while causal propositions are deemed to be, at least in part, independent of human conversational contexts. The same speaker mightÂ ascribe different truth values to the same counterfactual statement in different contexts. For example, I might maintain that â€˜If I had let go off the stone, it would have fallen to the groundâ€™ is true in a lecture on gravitational laws, andÂ false in a conversational contextÂ in a where I am suggesting that no person in their right mindÂ would have let the stone fall - like in a conversation about semi-precisious stones, for example. Thus, in different conversational contexts, the same counterfactual statement might have different propositional content, unlike causal propositions, whose propositional content is supposed to represent purely objective matter of fact.</p>

<p>One might try to rid the counterfactual analyses of its subjectiveness by stipulating that counterfactual conditionals are to be interpreted in such a way which is suited to conversations in which causal matters are the subject of discourse. ButÂ if this manouvre ridsÂ the counterfactual analysis of the problem ofÂ subjectivity,Â Â it brings in circularity. Instead of the counterfactual analysis throwing light on the meaning of causal statements, we would already need to have a firm grasp of the notion of causality in order to interpret counterfactual statements in ways that are appropriate to the conversational contexts in which they are used.</p>

<p>Thus, on grounds of itsÂ context-dependence,Â  andÂ implicit dependence on the meaning of causation, it seems that any counterfactual analyses of causation is misguided.Â </p>

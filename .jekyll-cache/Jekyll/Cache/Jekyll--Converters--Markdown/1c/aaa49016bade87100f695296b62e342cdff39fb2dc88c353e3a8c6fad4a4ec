I"Å<p>The more we strive to learn a new skill or inculcate a personality trait, the harder it seems. The newfound awareness of the task at hand bears down on us. We become painfully conscious of our own limitations and ignorance ‚Äì of the distance between us and the goal.  Take writing, for example. The more I read, or the more attention I pay to words and grammar and style, the more horrible I feel about my own prose. It was more than 6 years ago that I decided that I‚Äôd start making a conscious effort into improving my writing, and after all these years I am as far being a good writer as I have ever been. Or so it would appear.</p>

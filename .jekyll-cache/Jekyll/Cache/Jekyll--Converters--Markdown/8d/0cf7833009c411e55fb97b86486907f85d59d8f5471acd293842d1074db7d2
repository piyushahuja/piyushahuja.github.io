I"s<p>The Problem: Alice has to send information to Bob. But the transfer should achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It should be tamper-proof. If modified it should be detected by Bob</li>
  <li>It should be private or encrypted. No one but Bob can read it. Bob should be able to decrypt it.</li>
  <li>It should be fixed length? compressed? anthing else?</li>
</ul>

<p>Checksum algorithms are a way to make your message tamper-proof . What makes them tampter-proof? The property that even a sligh change in input changes the output quite radically. Given a message, you run it through the checksum algorithm, which the recipient knows. The recipient also receives the checksum through some independent source. If any single bit of the message was modified, youâ€™d know. Checksums need not themselves contain the message, so they can be publicly displayed, and also made to have an output of fixed length.</p>

<p>Hash functions</p>

<p>They are one-way, that is, functions whose inverse is difficult to calculate.</p>

<p>Terms to understand: SHA1, SHA256, ROT13, B64 encoding, BCrypt, RSA, Diffie Helman, PGP, Public/Private keys</p>

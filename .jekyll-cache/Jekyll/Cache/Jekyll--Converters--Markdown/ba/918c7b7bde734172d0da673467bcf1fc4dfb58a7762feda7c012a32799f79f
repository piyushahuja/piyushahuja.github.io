I"Ð<p>What are the things that appear to us as sun, the stars and the moon? The sun rises every day, makes it way across the sky, and then sets. The moon and the stars do something similar at the time the sun is set. And then the same thing happens again and again, roughly. The sun is always of the same size, but sometimes it takes longer to traverse the sky, sometimes lesser. And the moon has phases. And then there were the rare phenonmenon of the eclipses.</p>

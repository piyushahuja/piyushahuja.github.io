I"F*<p>The first time I met her, she appeared out-of-left field. Quite literally. I froze on the spot as the music stopped in Josh’s Radically Honesty Dating, a figure to my left took one big sideways step towards me, and there she was. A person I had not noticed in the room before, even though I had scanned it. She stood right in front of me, with sustained eye contact, and a hint of a smile in them - as if she was already familiar with me.</p>

<p>It turned out that she had seen me stage a walk out, earlier, in Jayaraja’s Mindful Communication workshop. She was present and curious. When I rambled on about me being a person who still follows the old fashioned ideas of duty and obligation, she asked what did duty mean for me. She spoke about her recent breakups, and her being polyamorous. It didn’t occur to me where she was based or how old she was, but she seemed exude a calmness and a sense of security and acceptance. Someone who would be healthy for me.  My kind of person.</p>

<hr />
<p>A month later…(yesterday)</p>

<p>She stood there in the doorway, smiling, barefoot, slim, a little sexy (though I wasn’t sure we would go there), as I arrived at the address of the flat in Lewes. It wasn’t hers - I would find out shortly. I was greeted by two lithe, cunning-looking unfriendly dogs - a pair of Whippets. They were also not hers.</p>

<p>She was house-sitting for her mate, dog-sitting for her therapist, and had another friend visiting. We would drop her soon, the dog would later be picked up  after a walk in the park, and soon we had the place and the night to ourselves.</p>

<p>She gave me a tour of the house. Separate bedrooms was what she had offered: she showed me my bedroom and made my bedding.</p>

<p>We chatted as she started cooking me dinner; I sat on the countertop. She threw in mushrooms-garlic-spinach-cream-pasta, and salmon.
I asked if I could do anything: I was uncomfortable with doing nothing but watch, and she was uncomfortable with my discomfort. “Do you sometimes people-please?” she asked me. “In my experience people who are uncomfortable in such situations are also people pleasers”.</p>

<p>She didn’t have a recipe in mind: she was just kind of throwing stuff together, she said. I told her about Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. “May we could add some lime”, she said.</p>

<p>At one point, when the silence felt awkward, I started asking something, but she shut me up firmly but smilingly. “cant talk while I’m doing all this”. It was a little awkward and embarrasing, but she was on the money with her needs and boundaries.</p>

<p>She asked me to taste. “Was it better before?”. “How much salt did you put?”…..something something “I think it needs more salt, but it depends on person to person”, I said. And she added more salt. “It is better now.”</p>

<p>I finally eased my discomfort by putting the dishes and the cultery out.</p>

<hr />

<p>Why could I not simply watch her cook? She was giving, and I was receiving. Why was it so uncomfortable for me to receive, having already travelled so far, tolerated her dogs, and accompanied her on the drop-off?</p>

<p>Those who expect to be treated with certain standards would not accept being invited when so much was going on,  not being told of the dogs. She had said it was her “downtime”, so she gave me the wrong idea.</p>

<p>But I drop my standards; taking pride in my adaptability.</p>

<p>Would I expect this of her if I were inviting her?</p>

<hr />

<p>Sammie grew up in Warrington, a “very ordinary place”, between Liverpool and Manchester. The relationships in her family were strained. “I don’t know why my parents stayed together for so long, they were totally incompatible”. She got along better with her father; her then sister (now brother) - a year older, got along better with her mother. Her parents separated when she was 10, she moved out of the house at 17. Only recently she had repaired her relationship with the members of her family: she visited her dad in Malta who looked old and poor and who she “somehow gets”, her Mom visited her, and she attended her brother’s marriage.</p>

<p>She went to university in Brighton, where she lived in a campervan and pursued a course in Education and then Teacher Training. She now worked as a teacher for students with special needs: often troubled kids placed in foster homes.</p>

<p>She was well travelled: from SE Asia to NZ to USA to Europe and many other places. She had worked a variety of odd jobs.</p>

<p>She recounted a story of a Torture Garden party in the country mansion in Stanmer Park. She also hosted campfire evenings once a month, attended poly book clubs, and used to go to climbing with an ex-gf.</p>

<p>She didn’t seem too curious about me, until much later, when we were driving back to the house. She  asked me when I moved here. I started rambling about my culture shock at Oxford. She didn’t respond much, and shifted the topic.</p>

<hr />

<p>Point to note: I didn’t like she went silent when I was being vulnerable, but instead of noticing and vocalising that, I started reminding myself to not be vulnerable. Thus, I dishonoured myself.</p>

<hr />

<p>We ate dinner in the conservatory. “Do you drink or smoke?” she asked me. The conversation proceeded to drugs: she was into them, and was curious why I wasn’t because “I am always interested in the answer to that question”. She tried to influence me a bit, but she wasn’t pushy.  “Why do you not think of the growth potential”, or that , some people never leave their hometowns. “They’re missing out on experiences”. I had enough other experiences I still had to pursue, I told her. I asked if she was a little bit disappointed that we couldn’ havt drugs together. She was. I told her I believe in doing things consciously and mindfully.  One shouldn’t do them if its not a “Heal Yeah!”, she said.</p>

<p>We talked about what we remembered from our first encounter. “Do you remember what we talked about?” she asked. She marked our position on the map. And our texting. She was showing curiosity about me. “Who are your closest people?” was one of her questions. While thinking of what to tell her of Debbie, I smiled.  “You’re cute,” she said.</p>

<p>She put her feet on my lap.</p>

<p>She laughed as we ate scones with clotted cream and jam, and I said “Fuckton of cream”, mimicking her. She found me saying it funny. “It Doesn’t sound like one of the things I usually say… You say it like a child would do”.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“How old are you?, she asked. I answered, and reflect the question. “32”.</p>

<p>“Do you believe in astrology?” 
“I dont” she said. “How does it matter to their personality if a baby pops out this week or a week later - their brain and everything are already developed!””</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“I made your bedroom but now I wish we could change that” she said, smilingly and smoothly. “You mean sleep next to you?” I asked. She nodded. “Could we do that?” She said yes, and this time I nodded.</p>

<p>As simple as that.</p>

<p>And then we continued chatting…</p>

<hr />

<p>In the bedroom, I started with “Lets have a conversation about boundaries”. That was a good opener.
I spoke about sexual health and about preference for condom if we were to go there. But then I rambled about my feelings: that I felt she was more experienced, that she might expect things from me, that I dont do hookups or ONS and this was something new for me, that I am usually nervous the first time.</p>

<p>I regret talking about about some of those feelings: it changed the energy of our interaction.</p>

<p>I have enough experience now that I could have spoken from a position of power: I wanted to go slow, it would help me if she tells me what kind of touches she likes (“she likes novelty, squashing”).</p>

<p>She expressed concern as to my feelings if we were to not meet again, yet she wanted to reassure me that she is not attached to the idea of sex and performance.  It would say nothing of tonight if we do not meet again: she has had great sex with guys and still sometimes not met them again. I reassured her that I would not get attached, this is a moment to moment thing for me. “I wish I were like that,” she said.</p>

<p>“What would you like to do to me?”” she asked at one point. (I didn’t know how to answer that)</p>

<p>She didn’t want any wetness: licking or wet kisses.</p>

<p>Every now and then, she would move my hand to show the touch she wanted.</p>

<p>“What are your kinks?” she asked at another poin (I didnt know how to answer that either, but I quickly made something up as if answering an exam question: 1. messy liquids - milk, oil “We just found one of our incompatibilities” she said and 2. vampires. “You should meet &lt;one of her exes who enjoyed the same&gt;” she said.</p>

<p>“This would be a real mindfuck, but sometimes I do not want you to do the things when I show you how I like to be touched”</p>

<p>She said she doesn’t like kissing, though she is okay with being kissed. When I expressed surprise, “no, really, ask my ex - she would tell you that”</p>

<p>She liked being squashed. “Not too heavy”</p>

<p>“Do you like to massage?” she asked. “No. Well…unless its a yoni massage.” This made her laugh. “Is this what those hippies call fingering?”</p>

<p>“I would take it off when I am at a point where I myself couldnt help but take it off” she said of her panties, when I tugged at them to check if its okay to take them off.
She liked being touched through it, being teased.</p>

<p>My beard bothered her. Her skin was sensitive. So her face became a forbidden zone. While stimulating her, she offered her figers instead of her mouth or nipples.</p>

<p>“Do you want to go in there?”, she said. “I dont like touching condoms”, she said, just as I grabbed the condom she had put by the bedside.  I wasn’t fully aroused, it slipped off, so I let it be.</p>

<p>She was almost allergic to condoms. I asked her about STIs. “I am risky since I broke up” she said. But she was caring: had on her mind that I should be careful with genital contact, even fingering, because I wanted to practice safe sex. I realized she didn’t practice self care.</p>

<hr />

<p>Why did I not want to receive touch? Because she was exhausted, she had cooked me dinner, and I didn’t really need touch. I was happy to get more practice making love rather than being loved.</p>

<p>It bothered me that my beard bothered me. “I should have shaved I said”. Thus, I dishonoured myself. Would I have expected her to shave if her bodily hair bothered me? No.</p>

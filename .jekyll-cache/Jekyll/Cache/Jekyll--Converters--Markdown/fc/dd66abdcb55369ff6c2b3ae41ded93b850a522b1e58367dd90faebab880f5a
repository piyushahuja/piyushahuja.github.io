I"„4<p>The first time I met her, she appeared out-of-left field. Quite literally. I froze on the spot as the music stopped in Joshâ€™s Radically Honesty Dating, a figure to my left took one big sideways step towards me, and there she was. A person I had not noticed in the room before, even though I had scanned it. She stood right in front of me, with sustained eye contact, and a hint of a smile in them - as if she was already familiar with me.</p>

<p>It turned out that she had seen me stage a walk out, earlier, in Jayarajaâ€™s Mindful Communication workshop. She was present and curious. When I rambled on about me being a person who still follows the old fashioned ideas of duty and obligation, she asked what did duty mean for me. She spoke about her recent breakups, and her being polyamorous. It didnâ€™t occur to me where she was based or how old she was, but she seemed exude a calmness and a sense of security and acceptance. Someone who would be healthy for me.  My kind of person.</p>

<hr />
<p>A month laterâ€¦(yesterday)</p>

<p>She stood there in the doorway, smiling, barefoot, slim, a little sexy (though I wasnâ€™t sure we would go there), as I arrived at the address of the flat in Lewes. It wasnâ€™t hers - I would find out shortly. I was greeted by two lithe, cunning-looking unfriendly dogs - a pair of Whippets. They were also not hers.</p>

<p>She was house-sitting for her mate, dog-sitting for her therapist, and had another friend visiting. We would drop her soon, the dog would later be picked up  after a walk in the park, and soon we had the place and the night to ourselves.</p>

<p>She gave me a tour of the house. Separate bedrooms was what she had offered: she showed me my bedroom and made my bedding.</p>

<p>We chatted as she started cooking me dinner; I sat on the countertop. She threw in mushrooms-garlic-spinach-cream-pasta, and salmon.
I asked if I could do anything: I was uncomfortable with doing nothing but watch, and she was uncomfortable with my discomfort. â€œDo you sometimes people-please?â€ she asked me. â€œIn my experience people who are uncomfortable in such situations are also people pleasersâ€.</p>

<p>She didnâ€™t have a recipe in mind: she was just kind of throwing stuff together, she said. I told her about Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. â€œMay we could add some limeâ€, she said.</p>

<p>At one point, when the silence felt awkward, I started asking something, but she shut me up firmly but smilingly. â€œcant talk while Iâ€™m doing all thisâ€. It was a little awkward and embarrasing, but she was on the money with her needs and boundaries.</p>

<p>She asked me to taste. â€œWas it better before?â€. â€œHow much salt did you put?â€â€¦..something something â€œI think it needs more salt, but it depends on person to personâ€, I said. And she added more salt. â€œIt is better now.â€</p>

<p>I finally eased my discomfort by putting the dishes and the cultery out.</p>

<hr />

<p>Why could I not simply watch her cook? She was giving, and I was receiving. Why was it so uncomfortable for me to receive, having already travelled so far, tolerated her dogs, and accompanied her on the drop-off?</p>

<p>Those who expect to be treated with certain standards would not accept being invited when so much was going on,  not being told of the dogs. She had said it was her â€œdowntimeâ€, so she gave me the wrong idea.</p>

<p>But I drop my standards; taking pride in my adaptability.</p>

<p>Would I expect this of her if I were inviting her?</p>

<hr />

<p>Sammie grew up in Warrington, a â€œvery ordinary placeâ€, between Liverpool and Manchester. The relationships in her family were strained. â€œI donâ€™t know why my parents stayed together for so long, they were totally incompatibleâ€. She got along better with her father; her then sister (now brother) - a year older, got along better with her mother. Her parents separated when she was 10, she moved out of the house at 17. Only recently she had repaired her relationship with the members of her family: she visited her dad in Malta who looked old and poor and who she â€œsomehow getsâ€, her Mom visited her, and she attended her brotherâ€™s marriage.</p>

<p>She went to university in Brighton, where she lived in a campervan and pursued a course in Education and then Teacher Training. She now worked as a teacher for students with special needs: often troubled kids placed in foster homes.</p>

<p>She was well travelled: from SE Asia to NZ to USA to Europe and many other places. She had worked a variety of odd jobs.</p>

<p>She recounted a story of a Torture Garden party in the country mansion in Stanmer Park. She also hosted campfire evenings once a month, attended poly book clubs, and used to go to climbing with an ex-gf.</p>

<p>She didnâ€™t seem too curious about me, until much later, when we were driving back to the house. She  asked me when I moved here. I started rambling about my culture shock at Oxford. She didnâ€™t respond much, and shifted the topic.</p>

<hr />

<p>Point to note: I didnâ€™t like she went silent when I was being vulnerable, but instead of noticing and vocalising that, I started reminding myself to not be vulnerable. Thus, I dishonoured myself.</p>

<hr />

<p>We ate dinner in the conservatory. â€œDo you drink or smoke?â€ she asked me. The conversation proceeded to drugs: she was into them, and was curious why I wasnâ€™t because â€œI am always interested in the answer to that questionâ€. She tried to influence me a bit, but she wasnâ€™t pushy.  â€œWhy do you not think of the growth potentialâ€, or that , some people never leave their hometowns. â€œTheyâ€™re missing out on experiencesâ€. I had enough other experiences I still had to pursue, I told her. I asked if she was a little bit disappointed that we couldnâ€™ havt drugs together. She was. I told her I believe in doing things consciously and mindfully.  One shouldnâ€™t do them if its not a â€œHeal Yeah!â€, she said.</p>

<p>We talked about what we remembered from our first encounter. â€œDo you remember what we talked about?â€ she asked. She marked our position on the map. And our texting. She was showing curiosity about me. â€œWho are your closest people?â€ was one of her questions. While thinking of what to tell her of Debbie, I smiled.  â€œYouâ€™re cute,â€ she said.</p>

<p>She put her feet on my lap.</p>

<p>She laughed as we ate scones with clotted cream and jam, and I said â€œFuckton of creamâ€, mimicking her. She found me saying it funny. â€œIt Doesnâ€™t sound like one of the things I usually sayâ€¦ You say it like a child would doâ€.</p>

<p>â€¦</p>

<p>â€œHow old are you?, she asked. I answered, and reflect the question. â€œ32â€.</p>

<p>â€œDo you believe in astrology?â€ 
â€œI dontâ€ she said. â€œHow does it matter to their personality if a baby pops out this week or a week later - their brain and everything are already developed!â€â€</p>

<p>â€¦</p>

<p>â€œI made your bedroom but now I wish we could change thatâ€ she said, smilingly and smoothly. â€œYou mean sleep next to you?â€ I asked. She nodded. â€œCould we do that?â€ She said yes, and this time I nodded.</p>

<p>As simple as that.</p>

<p>And then we continued chattingâ€¦</p>

<hr />

<p>In the bedroom, I started with â€œLets have a conversation about boundariesâ€. That was a good opener.
I spoke about sexual health and about preference for condom if we were to go there. But then I rambled about my feelings: that I felt she was more experienced, that she might expect things from me, that I dont do hookups or ONS and this was something new for me, that I am usually nervous the first time.</p>

<p>I regret talking about about some of those feelings: it changed the energy of our interaction.</p>

<p>I have enough experience now that I could have spoken from a position of power: I wanted to go slow, it would help me if she tells me what kind of touches she likes (â€œshe likes novelty, squashingâ€).</p>

<p>She expressed concern as to my feelings if we were to not meet again, yet she wanted to reassure me that she is not attached to the idea of sex and performance.  It would say nothing of tonight if we do not meet again: she has had great sex with guys and still sometimes not met them again. I reassured her that I would not get attached, this is a moment to moment thing for me. â€œI wish I were like that,â€ she said.</p>

<p>â€œWhat would you like to do to me?â€â€ she asked at one point. (I didnâ€™t know how to answer that)</p>

<p>She didnâ€™t want any wetness: licking or wet kisses.</p>

<p>Every now and then, she would move my hand to show the touch she wanted.</p>

<p>â€œWhat are your kinks?â€ she asked at another poin (I didnt know how to answer that either, but I quickly made something up as if answering an exam question: 1. messy liquids - milk, oil â€œWe just found one of our incompatibilitiesâ€ she said and 2. vampires. â€œYou should meet &lt;one of her exes who enjoyed the same&gt;â€ she said.</p>

<p>â€œThis would be a real mindfuck, but sometimes I do not want you to do the things when I show you how I like to be touchedâ€</p>

<p>She said she doesnâ€™t like kissing, though she is okay with being kissed. When I expressed surprise, â€œno, really, ask my ex - she would tell you thatâ€</p>

<p>She liked being squashed. â€œNot too heavyâ€</p>

<p>â€œDo you like to massage?â€ she asked. â€œNo. Wellâ€¦unless its a yoni massage.â€ This made her laugh. â€œIs this what those hippies call fingering?â€</p>

<p>â€œI would take it off when I am at a point where I myself couldnt help but take it offâ€ she said of her panties, when I tugged at them to check if its okay to take them off.
She liked being touched through it, being teased.</p>

<p>My beard bothered her. Her skin was sensitive. So her face became a forbidden zone. When my fingers were penetrating her, she offered her fingers instead of her mouth or nipples.</p>

<p>â€œDo you want to go in there?â€, she said. â€œI dont like touching condomsâ€, she said, just as I grabbed the condom she had put by the bedside.  I wasnâ€™t fully aroused, it slipped off, so I let it be.</p>

<p>She was almost allergic to condoms. I asked her about STIs. â€œI am risky since I broke upâ€ she said. But she was caring: had on her mind that I should be careful with genital contact, even fingering, because I wanted to practice safe sex. I realized she didnâ€™t practice self care.</p>

<p>She was using the lube and stimulating her clitoris.</p>

<p>We switched to a final position after she had orgasmed. I spooned her from the back and massaged her breasts.</p>

<p>â€œAre you horny?â€ she asked me as she felt my erection. â€œWould you like to cum?â€</p>

<p>Yes and No, I said. I was confused myself. I was aroused, but I didnâ€™t know what she had in mind. I didnâ€™t want a blowjob. And I wasnâ€™t in the mood to be in her.</p>

<p>She asked why not.</p>

<p>I couldnâ€™t explain properly, but I mumbled something about not doing it the first time, about needing the security that this will continue to do it, that it is precious to me.</p>

<p>â€œIt is also sacred for some peopleâ€ she said. I told her it is sacred for me to.</p>

<p>She recounter a story about how for her, it is her want to orgasm everytime she has sex, and how she expressed that with some partner who took it by the stride. She went on to comment that we still carry some heritage from our socialization that is not sex-positive, implying that not wanting to orgasm means Iâ€™m not sex-positive. I let it slip.</p>

<hr />

<p>Why did I not want to receive touch? Because she was exhausted, she had cooked me dinner, and I didnâ€™t really need touch. I was happy to get more practice making love rather than being loved.</p>

<p>About my beard, I said â€œI should have shavedâ€. Would I have expected her to shave if her bodily hair bothered me? No. Thus, I dishonoured myself. I wasnâ€™t accepted as I was, and I internalized the non-acceptance.</p>

<p>I should have been more careful with STIs. Fingering could also be risky, and I didnâ€™t wash my hands properly or frequently.</p>

<p>In the dark, I couldnâ€™t locate the cliteros and stimulate it properly myself.</p>

<p>In the communication later, I could have taken up her comment about cultural heritage and sex-positivism. It had made me feel as if my â€œNoâ€ wasnâ€™t respected.</p>

<hr />

<p>The next morning I left her coffee by the bedside and went for a walk. She messaged â€œCuddles?â€ just as I left the door. She also apologized for not having been very present.</p>

<p>I was back within ten.</p>

<p>I proposed going out and she was up for it,  but she didnâ€™t seem to be in a romantic mood.</p>

<p>We drove to Brighton and got us breakfast at Red Roasters. Egg and Lamb and Fig with Burratta and Toasted Bread. She had paid for parking, I paid for breakfast, though she thought that had been unfair on me. I liked her for her sense of equality.</p>

<p>She asked me about my usual day, about my plans. She spoke about her work and how the school system was structured for kids in trouble.  She was conscientious and wanted to do good. She showed me her videos. She was fun, lively, a little bit crazy but wholesome. She went to the loo one door and came back from some other. â€œI would probably have the worst sense of direction amongst all the people you would knowâ€, she said. But she ownede it laughed at herself for it.</p>

I"¥<p>RL methods follow two general ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Policy Based: One way to solve RL tasks is by estimating how ‚Äúgood‚Äù a state or state/action pair is, and then we could have our agent behave greedily.
These model and optimize the policy directly (rather than indirectly). The value of the reward (objective) function depends on this policy and then various algorithms can be applied to optimize for the best reward.</li>
</ul>

I"Ü<p>RL methods follow two general ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Value Based: We could estimate how ‚Äúgood‚Äù a state or state/action pair is, and then we could have our agent behave greedily.</li>
  <li>Policy Based: We could find an optimal policy, a policy being a function that outputs an action for each state. 
These model and optimize the policy directly (rather than indirectly).</li>
</ul>

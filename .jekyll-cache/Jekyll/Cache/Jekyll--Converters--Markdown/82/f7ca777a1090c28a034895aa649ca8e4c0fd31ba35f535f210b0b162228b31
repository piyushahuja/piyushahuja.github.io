I"&<p>Modern Philosophy is mired in a confusion of terms.  However, the terms themselves are not central to
a discussion of metaphysics - the various philosophical positions they represent are. My task here is to throw light on these positions by demarcating the boundaries between these positions and what they commit us to for coherence and consistency. I would use the symbol $ for saying ‘I hope I am justified in using these terms interchangeably in this context’, and I would be grateful for the reader to point out when I am not.</p>

I".<p>Causation, for the purpose of this essay, is taken to be a relation between events. (One might alternatively define causation where the relata are framed as facts, or states of affairs, or an agent and an event. That analysis then would differ, although there are strong arguments against the use of some of these, e.g. Davidson’s slingshot argument against fact causation). Counterfactuals, to counterfactual conditionals, are statements of the form ‘If it had been the case that p, then it would have been the case that q’ - where the antecedent expresses something that is ‘contrary to fact’, or what is actually the case, and the auxiliary verbs appearing in the antecedent and the consequent are subjunctive in mood.  An analyses of causation in terms of counterfactuals would trace the meanings of the statements of causation, like ‘Event c was a cause of event e’,  to counterfactual conditionals of the form ‘If c had not happened, then e would not have happened’ (Here, c and e are shorthands for cause and effect).</p>

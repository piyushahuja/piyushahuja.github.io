Make sure you are crystal clear on what sort of book your friend is trying to write. If you’re at all confused about that, ask questions. Even if you are sure, it doesn’t hurt to ask: “Before I comment, can you tell me a little about your goals? It seems to me like you’re writing a sci-fi novel about the effects of overpopulation, and you’d like the reader to understand that our rising birth rates are causing problems. Is that right?”</p>

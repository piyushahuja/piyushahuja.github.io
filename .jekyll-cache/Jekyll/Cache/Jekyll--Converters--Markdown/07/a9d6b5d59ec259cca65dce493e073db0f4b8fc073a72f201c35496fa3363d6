I"ï<p>They love meâ€¦they love me not.</p>

<p>By now I have a pretty good handle on the question. I donâ€™t have to pick the petals of a poor flower: my body could tell.</p>

<p>â€œ<em>You sort of knowâ€¦donâ€™t youâ€</em> said my friend Dawne. That you just <em>know</em> whether youâ€™d hit it off with someone - pre-communication, pre-familiarity, pre- any dating rituals - was an idea that wafted through my skeptical mind - completely bypassed it - and struck a chord in the same area where the knowingness resided. It was true and I just knew it.</p>

<p>But have there been times when I sort of â€œjust knewâ€ that I am not loved, but eventually I was? When my gut instinct has been wrong?</p>

<p>This is my attempt to reflect on the times Iâ€™ve felt loved, or acutely felt the absence of it, and everything in between.</p>

<p>B at Florence House</p>

<p>The first signal was in the m/w reunion. I was looking at her, but she wasnâ€™t looking for me. And I was suddenly overcome by feeling of grief, with memories of all those times when I imagine being loved but the reality swerves differently. â€œShe doesnâ€™t love meâ€. â€œIâ€™ll never be lovedâ€</p>

<p>Eventually, I sorted myself out and mustered the strength to meet her. When we hugged, she said, â€œyouâ€™re my favourite Indian man hereâ€ (I was the only Indian).</p>

<p>She spent the closing with Simon.</p>

<p>At the parting, she mentioned she was going to meet â€œsomeone specialâ€.</p>

<p>I was her second pick. I wasnâ€™t her desire: I was her safety.</p>

<p>Seven months after that, we became lovers.</p>

<p>She spent the closing with Simon.</p>

<p>But the next morning, she sat next to me.</p>

<p>Towards the end, she offered me a lift.</p>

  <p>Plunge into the sea of language and splash around in it. Almost all humor (except situational and physical humor) is rooted in language: jokes, puns, anecdotes, observations, funny stories… So make English (or whatever your native language is) your home and visit every room. Read constantly, write constantly, care about each word you write, try writing poetry, and so on.  The good news is that humor works in any vernacular. Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock speak differently, but both love words. So your goal shouldn’t be to speak like someone else. It should be to plum the depth of your own style of speaking – to expand your vocabulary and expressiveness in ways that fit your personality.   It may seem as if this has nothing to do with being funny, but the more you play with words – the more expert and relaxed you become with them, the more you flirt with them, fight with them, mangle them, and coin them – the more avenues you’ll create for humor to slip out. </p>

    <p>True, spontaneous wit results from using language to defend an attitude  which runs counter to what is expected, or which is hard to defend. It is a kin to a creative solution, showing a third way when there seem to be none, and the joy comes from the discovery and the reveal. <strong>Honesty is always nuanced, and if done right, even funny.</strong></p>

  <p>“There are, it has been said, two types of people in the world. There are those who, when presented with a glass that is exactly half full, say: this glass is half full. And then there are those who say: this glass is half empty. 
The world belongs, however, to those who can look at the glass and say: What’s up with this glass? Excuse me? Excuse me? This is my glass? I don’t think so. My glass was full! And it was a bigger glass! Who’s been pinching my beer?
And at the other end of the bar the world is full of the other type of person, who has a broken glass, or a glass that has been carelessly knocked over (usually by one of the people calling for a larger glass) or who had no glass at all, because he was at the back of the crowd and had failed to catch the barman’s eye. ”</p>

    <p>Antithesis:</p>

    <p>bringing out of a contrast in the ideas by an obvious contrast in the words, clauses, or sentences, within a parallel grammatical structure. Oscar Wilde is known to have extensively used antithesis:</p>

<p>Although seemingly ingenious, Wildean antitheses are, in fact, quite formulaic:
    - Make a statement that is relatively obvious (ex. The well bred contradict other people 
    -  Begin the second half in a rather obvious manner. (The wise.. )
    -  Take an odd turn. (… contradict themselves. )</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, the formula goes something like this: “X is Y. Not X is not Y”</p>

    <p>Applying an adjective to the wrong noun (Transferred Epithets).</p>

    <p>An epithet is an adjective or adjectival phrase that characterizes a place, a thing, or a person that helps make the characteristics of this thing more prominent.</p>

    <p>Epithets employed by a skillful orator, will be found to be, in fact, so many abridged arguments, the force of which is sufficiently conveyed by a mere hint.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <p>‘We ought to take warning from the bloody revolution of France</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>the Epithet suggests one of the reasons for our being warned; and that, not less clearly, and more forcibly, than if the argument had been stated at length.

The New Rhetoric derives its empiricist flavor from a pervasive respect for clarity and directness of language. Rhetors use epithets to direct their audience to see their point of view, using verbal forms of imagery as a persuasive tactic. Orators have a variety of epithets that they can employ that have different meanings. 
The most common are fixed epithets and transferred epithets. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A fixed epithet is the repetitive use of the same word or phrase for the same person or object.</p>

<p>A transferred epithet qualifies a noun other than the person or thing it is describing. This is also known as a hypallage. This can often involves shifting a modifier from the animate to the inanimate. tends to give our surroundings human qualities</p>

<p><strong>Multiple devices</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you wish to become a better writer you must write every day, and if you wish to become a fiction writer, you must write fiction every day. Thinking about your novel is not writing. Plotting is not writing. Character mapping is not writing. Only writing is writing. And the more you will write, the better you will get. It is that simple, and it is that hard.”  Notice the rhetorical devices at work? ( Anaphora, Epiphora, Antithesis.. )</p>

  <p>“‘Come in,’ I say. The knob turns, and in walks Bade Bhai. Even with bees buzzing inside my head I sit up straight. This is not just another rich asshole. He’s the asshole of all assholes. He flicks the cigar into the corner. Lets the door slide shut. After the click, he waits for a moment. Holds his gaze. Blinks. Then smiles. It’s the smile I’ve seen on the faces of thieves, child molesters, murderers, politicians. A smile of love. Compassion. Brotherhood.” (Alliteration? Anadiplosis? Tricolon? )</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“the rich get rich, and the poor get children” – This neatly combines several rhetorical devices, with a delightful twist. The first phrase is a straight diacope. The rich are then contrasted with the poor (antithesis). The second phrase mirrors the grammar of the first, making an isocolon, but instead of getting the diacope we expect (‘the poor get poor’), our expectations are cleverly confounded with a joke.]</p>

<p>Contradictions, opposition, inversion and violation of expectation is at the heart of wit</p>

<p>Memorable Expressions follow two principles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the moulding of something abstract into concrete metaphors,</li>
  <li>combination of two conflicting notions. e.g. Diverse Panel of Jews, Castle in the Air, Deafening Silence. The sounds of silence.</li>
  <li>Or both: Party Game for Horrible People</li>
</ul>

<p>Key to wit and humour: Make things interesting (OX1 instead of Oxford), Use metaphors (), use rarer words , exaggerate simple things   and understate big things, borrow from popular sources (Ars Longa, vita bravos)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Overstating the ordinary.</li>
</ul>

famished, not merely hungry;
the weather is ominous or exhilerating, not merely bad or good

<blockquote>
  <p>It is said than men fail not because they lack talent, but because they lack perseverance. And so go the unremarkable lives of most among us. The vicissitudes; the mundane responsibilities; that ever-present millstone of daily burden; it wears down the ambition, and replaces passions of youth with aspirations of middle-aged mediocrity. And yet, improbably, here was a man who had unbound himself from the shackles of the mundane. He had persevered; he had thwarted adversity; he had fought the good fight! At long last, he was about to revel in the spoils of his triumph. Victory was the reward for perseverance. And now, after all this time, victory was nothing if not inevitable.
This was Charles Lindbergh, lining up for an historic landing at that Paris airfield. It was Bobby Thomson, rounding third base after that pennant-winning home run. And it was Daniel LaRusso—having just subdued his opponent with a crane-kick so perfect even Miyagi himself could scarcely have defended against it—awaiting the referee’s inevitable pronouncement of that sweetest of all sweet utterances: “Winner”.
    And then, suddenly, without warning, that joyous daybreak of near-victory turned into the darkest of night. <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-asshole-thing-your-cat-has-ever-done/answer/Ben-Fitzgearl-1?ch=10&amp;share=b36a662c&amp;srid=3HW0">more….</a></p>

<p>Parataxis – Parataxis is using short, simple sentences.
Hypotaxis – Hypotaxis is a string of sentences, and it is in a sequence, and these sentences are linked by conjunctions (Polysybdeton), or they are linked by commas – they are also linked by dashes (Asyndeton). [That last sentence demonstrates all three.]</p>

<p>avoid or delay the main verb, to build up long sentences with sub-clauses
like Rudyard Kipling’s poem ‘If’, a 294-word sentence with 273 sub-clauses (Wikipedia entry) [Joni Mitchell song (‘If’, 2007, YouTube) – Roger Whittaker song (‘Song for Erik’, 1972, YouTube)]

“Space: the final frontier” [Star Trek]
‘Drink? Thanks. Your round. Really? Yes. Damn.’
Good for setting a scene [e.g. in a novel]
Can be used for ‘timeless rules, such as ‘like father, like son’, ‘each to his own’, ‘third time lucky’</p>

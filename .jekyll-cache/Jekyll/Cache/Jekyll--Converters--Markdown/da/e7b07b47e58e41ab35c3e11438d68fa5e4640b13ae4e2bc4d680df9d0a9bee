No thought you can think 
That encompasses the Great Self

Your essence
is immortal and unchanging
Yet it is the foundations for all that moves

Rest in the shimmering emptiness
That is the source of the world
And remember who you are

<p>I have to be somewhere where I desire something. To get it, I have to be someone, so the thought goes. What is that someone?</p>

<p>I could be spiritual.</p>

<p>I could be generous and giving.</p>

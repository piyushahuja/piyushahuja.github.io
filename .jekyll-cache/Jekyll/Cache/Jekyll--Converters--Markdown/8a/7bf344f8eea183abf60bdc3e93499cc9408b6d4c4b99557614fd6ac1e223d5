I"ÿ<p><strong>The Initiation</strong></p>

<p>I felt the presence of the divine feminine. Her breasts grazed my chest. Her hair fell on my body. Her fragranceâ€¦</p>

<p>Love was in the air. In the energy field.</p>

<p>I saw a vision.It was the dawn of civilization. I was an one of the early men. I was Purush. I was Adam.  The land was densely forested, possibly Ancient India. I was unclothed. In the centre of my heart was the spiritual light I was carrying. And besides me was the community of other spiritual beings.</p>

<p>When the thought came as to what we have done,  to this planet, to ourselves, our burst into tears.</p>

<p>In those two hours, I let go of all the wounds, all the sadness that I carried, all the memories of rejection and heartache.</p>

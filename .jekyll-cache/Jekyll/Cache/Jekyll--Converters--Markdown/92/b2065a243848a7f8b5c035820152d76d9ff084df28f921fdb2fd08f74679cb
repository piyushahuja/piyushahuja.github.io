<p>Is it absurd to suppose that only the present exists? 
Do tensed statements have tenseless truth conditions? Would that show that tense is unreal?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To say that only present exists, is that the only thing in our world is there here and now, and any talk about the past or the future is muchÂ like a fictional talk, which has its referent as something which doesnâ€™t exist.</p>
  </li>

    <p>When McTaggart says â€˜â€˜Time involves changeâ€™â€™, it seems like a sleight of hand. What does it mean? Time is the dimension of change. But that doesnâ€™t make anything clearer.
We observe time through A series and B series, or we observe the dimension of change through A series and B series.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

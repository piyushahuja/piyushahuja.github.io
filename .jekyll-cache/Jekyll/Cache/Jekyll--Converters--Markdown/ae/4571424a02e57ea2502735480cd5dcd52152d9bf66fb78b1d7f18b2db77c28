<p>Is there a type of story that is more suited on the stage (performance/plays/theater) than others?
This question previously had details. They are now in a comment.

Iâ€™m a theatre director, and I have three thoughts for you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On stage, we can only observe behavior. We canâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on inside a characterâ€™s head (as we can in a novel or in a filmâ€™s dream sequence). We can only hear what he says and see what he does.</li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously, there are exceptions to this. Shakespeare wrote soliloquies, and Tennessee Williams used a narrator in â€œThe Glass Menagerie.â€ Doing either well is extremely hard, because narration and inner monologues are literary devices, not immediately at home on the stage. If you employ them without having the talent of a Shakespeare or Williams, you risk writing plays that seem as if they were poorly-adapted from novels.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s tough to tell an entire story with just behavior, because you need the audience to understand key plot information, and beginners often canâ€™t figure out ways to convey it without having a character simply tell it to the audience.</p>

<p>One failure is the non-theatrical, literary speech. The other way is to insert clunky exposition into dialogue: â€œHere it is, 1986, and youâ€™re wearing a fedora!â€ You need to find another way!</p>

<p>Read this: David Mamet on Dramatic Writing.</p>

<p>If you insist on narration or soliloquies, make sure the character wants something and is using his speech to try to get it. That (using words to get something) is a form of behavior. That is dramatic. In Shakespeareâ€™s most famous soliloquy, Hamlet is actively trying to figure out whether to kill himself or not. Heâ€™s not explaining plot the the audience.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s instructive to track Anton Chekhovâ€™s growth as a playwright. In his first major play, â€œThe Seagull,â€ he created a fairly naturalistic world. That is, in general, it doesnâ€™t break of the fourth wall. Except it doesâ€”awkwardlyâ€”a few times. Itâ€™s very odd. You feel like youâ€™re watching a play similar in style to something Ibsen might have written, but then, out of nowhere, a character starts talking to the audience. Or maybe heâ€™s just talking to himself â€¦ out loud â€¦ for a really long time. The young Chekhov simply couldnâ€™t figure out another way to structure his play.</p>

<p>Since heâ€™s Chekhov, the speeches themselves are fantastic, so itâ€™s almost forgivable, but it still feels as if heâ€™s mashed two types of drama together in an unholy union.</p>

<p>His next play, â€œUncle Vanya,â€ suffers from the same defect. Itâ€™s a brilliant play. One of the best ever written. But, again, itâ€™s basically naturalistic, except in two places where characters talk to â€¦ no one? â€¦ to the audience? Still, itâ€™s more skillful than â€œThe Seagull.â€ In this later play, the monologues happen when characters are extremely agitated, so itâ€™s sort of believable they might talk to themselves. Chekhov was clearly wrestling with the problem, trying to find ways to make these speeches plausible.</p>

<p>In his next play, â€œThe Three Sisters,â€ he figures it out! He comes up with dramatic excuses for characters to talk to themselves at length. In one case, itâ€™s because a character is drunk. Itâ€™s plausible, because drunk people sometimes think theyâ€™re in company when theyâ€™re alone. In another case, itâ€™s because a character is talking to someone else who is offstage.</p>

<p>In his final play, â€œThe Cherry Orchard,â€ Chekhov was able to completely dispense with soliloquies. He figured out how to tell an entire story using interactions between charactersâ€”using behavior. And then he died. Which sucks for those of us who love his plays, but itâ€™s kind of a neat ending.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In each moment, each character should want something and be trying to get it. His need for this â€œsomethingâ€ must be really strong and there are only two possible reasons he doesnâ€™t immediately grab it: external obstacles and internal obstacles. For instance, a prince might want to rescue a sleeping beauty but be thwarted by a thicket of thorn bushes in his path. Thatâ€™s an external obstacle. If fear hiders him, thatâ€™s an internal obstacle.</li>
</ol>

<p>Every single thing a character does and says should be an attempt to overcome an obstacle in pursuit of his goal. If not, itâ€™s undramatic. Which is why exposition is a no-no. â€œMaking sure an the audience understands a plot pointâ€ is not a tactic that will get the character closer to his goal.</p>

<p>A major bug in plays by inexperienced writers is what I call â€œthe debate scene.â€ It usually means the writer is more concerned with an idea than with character. You can certainly express ideas with plays, but you must make them organic to the characters.</p>

<p>Or it means heâ€™s painted his characters into corners where they have goals but no possible options for achieving them. If your goal is to get me to give you a dollar and Iâ€™ve let you know thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™ll ever do this under any circumstances, itâ€™s not an interesting scene if you just keep saying â€œCome on! Give me a dollar!â€ over and over. If I simply wonâ€™t give it to you, Iâ€™ve won and youâ€™ve lost, and the scene should either be over or you should have a new goal: maybe stealing the candy bar you were going buy with my dollar.</p>

<p>In debate scenes, two characters argue for pages and pages. Neither seems to really be pursuing a goal, aside from maybe trying to convince the other of some intellectual point. And when itâ€™s clear thatâ€™s not working, the characters donâ€™t give up or switch tactics, they just keep on debating. At his worst, Shaw writes this way.</p>

<p>For an other example, read the end of â€œMedea.â€ Iâ€™m currently working on a production, and I wouldnâ€™t be bothering with it if I didnâ€™t think it was a great play, but it suffers at the end by turning a little debate-ish. Which makes it hard to stage without boring the audience.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to quote* at length, because I want you to see what Iâ€™m talking about. The following occurs after all the main action of the play has concluded. [Spoiler:] Medea has triumphed over Jason by killing their children, as well as killing his bride. Heâ€™s totally screwed. And he canâ€™t even take revenge, because sheâ€™s floating above him in a magic chariot. He canâ€™t reach her. There is nothing he can do. He know it; she knows it. Sheâ€™s won. Heâ€™s lost. The end â€¦ except not:</p>

<p>MEDEA
Your sons are dead. How does that feel?</p>

<p>JASON
They live on as spirits, who will haunt you to Hell.</p>

<p>MEDEA
The heavens know who started this.</p>

<p>JASON
They know your evil heart.</p>

<p>MEDEA
Hate on! I am so sick of your pathetic voice.</p>

<p>JASON
And I am heart-sick of yours. I would never hear it again.</p>

<p>MEDEA
Willingly. What are your last words to me?</p>

<p>JASON
Allow me my dead childrenâ€”
to bury them in peace, and mourn them.</p>

<p>MEDEA
No. I will bury them myself. â€¦</p>

<p>JASON
Then I call on the Fury of vengeance,
and the agents of Justice, to cut you down.</p>

<p>MEDEA
What god or higher power would listen to an oath-breaker and liar?</p>

<p>JASON
Filth! Child-murderer!</p>

<p>MEDEA
Go back and bury your bride.</p>

<p>JASON
I came here a father, and go home childless.</p>

<p>MEDEA
Your grief is just beginning. Wait until youâ€™re old.</p>

<p>JASON
Oh my children, dear sons.</p>

<p>MEDEA
Dear to their mother, not to you.</p>

<p>JASON
So dear you killed them?</p>

<p>MEDEA
That you might die of grief.</p>

<p>JASON
Let me just touch them once more:
hold them in my arms and kiss them one last time.</p>

<p>MEDEA
You rejected them, sent them into exile,
and now you want their kisses?</p>

<p>JASON
One last time â€¦</p>

<p>MEDEA
No. You waste your breath.</p>

<p>It kind of feels like this could go on forever. It could last for another few lines or another few hundred. Thereâ€™s no forward momentum. Medeaâ€™s goal is to make Jason suffer, but sheâ€™s already achieved that. â€œMaking him suffer moreâ€ isnâ€™t an interesting dramatic goal, because it doesnâ€™t up the ante of the last goal. Itâ€™s just the same goal all over again.</p>

<p>And aside from a few lines in which Jason asks to hold his dead childrenâ€”which heâ€™s already tried without successâ€”heâ€™s not really doing anything except saying forms of â€œI hate you.â€</p>

<p>Itâ€™s very hard for actors to make stagnant scenes like this work, but if they canâ€™t overcome the playwrightâ€™s blunder, the audience will start shifting in their seats. So donâ€™t write debate scenes!</p>

<p>Contrast the above with this scene from Shakespeareâ€™s â€œRichard III,â€ in which Lady Anne is pointing a sword Glouchester, who murdered her husband.</p>

<p>He lays his breast open: she offers [points] at it with his sword</p>

<p>GLOUCHESTER
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
But â€˜twas thy beauty that provoked me.
Nay, now dispatch; â€˜twas I that stabbâ€™d young Edward,
But â€˜twas thy heavenly face that set me on.</p>

<p>Here she lets fall the sword</p>

<p>Take up the sword again, or take up me.</p>

<p>LADY ANNE
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
I will not be the executioner.</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.</p>

<p>LADY ANNE
I have already.</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER
Tush, that was in thy rage:
Speak it again, and, even with the word,
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.</p>

<p>LADY ANNE
I would I knew thy heart.</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER
â€˜Tis figured in my tongue.</p>

<p>LADY ANNE
I fear me both are false.</p>

<p>GLOUCESTER
Then never man was true.</p>

<p>LADY ANNE
Well, well, put up your sword.</p>

<p>Here, Gloucester has a goal, which is to stop Lady Anne from fighting with him and agree to be his lover. She wants him dead, but internal obstacles (cowardliness) are stopping her from killing him. He understands her weakness and is exploiting it. This is forward momentum. This is actable.</p>

<p>For more information about goal-based dramatic writing, see the following books, which are for actors, not writers, but that doesnâ€™t matter. Theyâ€™re awesome for dramatists, too:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you think of each narrative medium (books, films, plays, etc) as a series of attempts to describe whatâ€™s happening in fictional worlds, youâ€™ll note that each can display some aspects of those worlds more easily than others.</li>
</ol>

<p>For instance, a historical novel has to waste thousands of words trying to evoke a Victorian dining room, whereas a film can do that instantly with an image. Films, on the other hand, have a hard time conveying charactersâ€™ thoughts, whereas a novel can do that effortlessly.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the twist: each medium is at its strongest when it evokes what it has the hardest time evoking.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m sure thatâ€™s confusing, so let me illustrate with radio plays. What does the radio play have a hard time evoking? Images! It has to do all its storytelling with sounds. When I was younger, I wanted to write and direct radio plays, and I wrongly thought the best stories for radio were ones in which images werenâ€™t important. So I came up with ideas like plays that were just phone conversations.</p>

<p>Then, one day, I heard a science fiction radio play in which a character said, â€œOh my God! Look at the size of that ship!â€</p>

<p>And it blew my mind. I realized it was the perfect line for a radio play. It evoked an image in a non-imagistic medium. If felt like magic, because â€œyou canâ€™t see things on the radio.â€ And yet it made me see something. That single line evoked a bigger space ship than the one at the end of â€œClose Encounters of the Third Kind.â€</p>

<p>In film, the most powerful moments are implied by cuts. We canâ€™t get inside the characterâ€™s head, but we can see a shot of him staring at something. Then we can cut to what heâ€™s looking at: a girl in a bikini. As if by magic, the film evokes lustâ€”an internal state, something it canâ€™t literally show.</p>

<p>In a play, the magic happens when you evoke the stuff plays canâ€™t literally display (without being clunky). The two main ones being inner psychology and offstage action.</p>

<p>Please read that last paragraph while keeping in mind my first two numbered points, above. Iâ€™m not suggesting you write a monologue in which a character explains what heâ€™s thinking. Iâ€™m suggesting that by watching his behavior we should come to understand what heâ€™s thinking.</p>

<p>And Iâ€™m also not suggesting a messenger should run on and describe the battle happening in the wings. Iâ€™m suggesting behavior should evoke an world beyond the stageâ€™s boundaries, as in â€œThe Three Sistersâ€ when characters long to go to Moscow.</p>

<p>The essence of dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, itâ€™s simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves.</p>

<p>â€“ Stanley Kubrick</p>

<p>The most powerful aspect of the â€œMona Lisaâ€ is the thing sheâ€™s smiling about. How did da Vinci paint that?</p>

<p>David Mamet on Dramatic Writing</p>

<p>Note: this is a memo Mamet sent to his writing team of â€œThe Unit,â€ a TV series for which he was head writer. I agree with everything he says, but he wrote it in all caps and didnâ€™t edit, so it contained lots of typos. Iâ€™ve normalized the case and fixed the errors. You can find the original, here:
David Mametâ€™s Master Class Memo to the Writers of The Unit</p>

<p>To the writers of â€œThe Unitâ€:</p>

<p>Greetings.</p>

<p>As we learn how to write this show, a recurring problem becomes clear.</p>

<p>The problem is this: to differentiate between drama and non-drama. Let me break it down, now.</p>

<p>Everyone in creation is screaming at us to make the show clear. We are tasked with, it seems, cramming a shitload of information into a little bit of time.</p>

<p>Our friends, the penguins, think that we, therefore, are employed to communicate informationâ€” and, so, at times, it seems to us.</p>

<p>But note: the audience will not tune in to watch information. You wouldnâ€™t, I wouldnâ€™t. No one would or will. The audience will only tune in and stay tuned to watch drama.</p>

<p>Question: what is drama? Drama, again, is the quest of the hero to overcome those things which prevent him from achieving a specific, acute goal.</p>

<p>So: we, the writers, must ask ourselves of every scene these three questions:</p>

<p>1) Who wants what?</p>

<p>2) What happens if they donâ€™t get it?</p>

<p>3) Why now?</p>

<p>The answers to these questions are litmus paper. Apply them, and their answers will tell you if the scene is dramatic or not.</p>

<p>If the scene is not dramatically written, it will not be dramatically acted.</p>

<p>There is no magic fairy dust which will make a boring, useless, redundant, or merely informative scene [dramatic] after it leaves your typewriter. You the writers are in charge of making sure every scene is dramatic.</p>

<p>This means all the â€œlittleâ€ expositional scenes of two people talking about a third. This bushwah* (and we all tend to write it on the first draft) is less than useless, should it finally, God forbid, get filmed.</p>

<p>[* nonsense.]</p>

<p>If the scene bores you when you read it, rest assured it will bore the actors, and will, then, bore the audience, and weâ€™re all going to be back at the breadline.</p>

<p>Someone has to make the scene dramatic. Itâ€™s not the actorâ€™s job. (The actorâ€™s job is to be truthful.) It is not the directorâ€™s job. His or her job is to film it straightforwardly and remind the actors to talk fast. It is your job.</p>

<p>Every scene must be dramatic. That means: the main character must have a simple, straightforward, pressing need which impels him or her to show up in the scene.</p>

<p>This need is why they came. It is what the scene is about. Their attempt to get this need met will lead, at the end of the scene, to failureâ€”this is how [we know] the scene is over. It, this failure, will, then, of necessity, propel us into the next scene.</p>

<p>All these attempts, taken together, will, over the course of the episode, constitute the plot.</p>

<p>Any scene, thus, which does not both advance the plot and stand alone (that is [work] dramatically by itself on its own merits) is either superfluous or incorrectly written.</p>

<p>Yes but, yes but, yes but, you say: What about the necessity of writing in all that â€œinformation?â€</p>

<p>And I respond â€œfigure it out.â€ Any dickhead in a blue suit can be (and is) taught to say â€œmake it clearerâ€ and â€œI want to know more about him.â€</p>

<p>When youâ€™ve made it so clear that even this blue-suited penguin is happy, both you and he or she will be out of a job.</p>

<p>The job of the dramatist is to make the audience wonder what happens next. [Itâ€™s] not to explain to them what just happened or to suggest to them what happens next.</p>

<p>Any dickhead, as above, can write, â€œBut, Jim, if we donâ€™t assassinate the prime minister in the next scene, all Europe will be engulfed in flames.â€</p>

<p>We are not getting paid to realize that the audience needs this information to understand the next scene, but to figure out how to write the scene before us such that the audience will be interested in what happens next.</p>

<p>Yes but, yes but, yes but, you reiterate.</p>

<p>And I respond figure it out.</p>

<p>How does one strike the balance between withholding and vouchsafing information? That is the essential task of the dramatist. And the ability to do that is what separates you from the lesser species in the blue suits.</p>

<p>Figure it out.</p>

<p>Start, every time, with this inviolable rule: the scene must be dramatic. It must start because the hero has a problem, and it must culminate with the hero finding him or herself either thwarted or educated that another way exists.</p>

<p>Look at your log lines. A log line reading â€œBob and sue discussâ€¦â€ is not describing a dramatic scene.</p>

<p>Please note that our outlines are, generally, spectacular. The drama flows out between the outline and the first draft.</p>

<p>Think like a filmmaker rather than a functionary, because, in truth, you are making the film. What you write, they will shoot.</p>

<p>Here are the danger signals: any time two characters are talking about a third, the scene is a crock of shit.</p>

<p>Any time any character is saying to another, â€œas you know,â€ that is, telling another character what you, the writer, need the audience to know, the scene is a crock of shit.</p>

<p>Do not write a crock of shit. Write a ripping three, four, seven minute scene which moves the story along, and you can, very soon, buy a house in Bel Air and hire someone to live there for you.</p>

<p>Remember you are writing for a visual medium. Most television writing, ours included, sounds like radio. The camera can do the explaining for you. Let it. What are the characters doingâ€”literally? What are they handling? What are they reading? What are they watching on television? What are they seeing?</p>

<p>If you pretend the characters canâ€™t speak, and write a silent movie, you will be writing great drama.</p>

<p>If you deprive yourself of the crutch of narration, exposition, indeed, of speech, you will be forced to work in a new mediumâ€”telling the story in pictures (also known as screenwriting).</p>

<p>This is a new skill. No one does it naturally. You can train yourself to do it, but you need to start.</p>

<p>I close with the one thought: look at the scene and ask yourself, â€œIs it dramatic? Is it essential? Does it advance the plot?â€</p>

<p>Answer truthfully.</p>

<p>If the answer is â€œno,â€ write it again or throw it out. If youâ€™ve got any questions, call me up.</p>

<p>Love,</p>

<p>David Mamet
Santa Monica, 19 Oct 05</p>

<p>(It is not your responsibility to know the answers, but it is your, and my, responsibility to know and to ask the right questions over and over until it becomes second nature. I believe they are listed above.)</p>

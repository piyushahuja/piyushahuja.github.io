<p>Jarod Lanier points out our tendency “reduce ourselves” in order to make our description of them appear more accurate, “information underrepresents reality”</p>

<p>Whitman says “I am large, I contain multitudes”.</p>

<p>And Nietzche has an answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can man know himself?… For the most important inquiry, however, there is a method. Let the young soul survey its own life with a view of the following question: “What have you truly loved thus far? What has ever uplifted your soul, what has dominated and delighted it at the same time?” Assemble these revered objects in a row before you and perhaps they will reveal a law by their nature and their order: the fundamental law of your very self. Compare these objects, see how they complement, enlarge, outdo, transfigure one another; how they form a ladder on whose steps you have been climbing up to yourself so far; for your true self does not lie buried deep within you, but rather rises immeasurably high above you, or at least above what you commonly take to be your I.</p>

<p><strong>Growing Up</strong></p>

<p>Growing up, I was heavily influenced by three animated shows: Heidi, The Adventures of TinTin and Dragon Ball Z.</p>

<p><strong>IIT Delhi years</strong></p>

<p>I was good at Maths, particularly abstract maths of the theory-building variety that constitutes Linear Algebra, Topology etc. A few of my professors (Anima Nagar, Subiman Kundu) recommended that I pursue graduate studies in Maths.</p>

<p><strong>Oxford years</strong></p>

<p>I discovered the works of David Foster Wallace and movies of Wes Anderson at roughly the same time.</p>

<p>I was a popular senior at IIT Delhi.</p>

<p><strong>Cambridge years</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>This is how most people see me.</p>

<p>physical appearance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>kind eyes that carry a twinkle or a sparkle</li>
  <li>deep and resonant voice</li>
  <li>warm and playful smile</li>
</ul>

<p>stuff i am conscious about: my facial skin has some scars. people often detect an underlying sadness in my facial expression. and male pattern baldness makes me look older than I am.</p>

<p>most salient virtues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>depth, wisdom, thoughtfulness and intelligence</li>
  <li>humour, playfulness, wit</li>
  <li>genuineness, integrity, honesty and commitment to truth</li>
  <li>curiosity, inquisitiveness</li>
  <li>kindness, care and warmth</li>
  <li>generosity</li>
  <li>openness</li>
</ul>

<p>stuff to work upon: I tend to keep myself quiet and small. I could embody more confidence and self-love.</p>

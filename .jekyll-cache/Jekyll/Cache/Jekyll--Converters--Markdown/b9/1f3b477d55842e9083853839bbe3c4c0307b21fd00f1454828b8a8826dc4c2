I"<p>They love me…they love me not.</p>

<p>I feel by now I have a pretty good handle on the question. I don’t have to pick the petals of a poor flower: my body could tell.</p>

<p>“You sort of know…don’t you” said my friend Dawne. The idea wafted through my skeptical mind - completely bypassed it - and struck a chord with the same area where the knowingness resided: my gut.</p>

<p>This is my attempt to reflect on the times I’ve been wrong, if I ever have been, and how to tell one from the other.</p>

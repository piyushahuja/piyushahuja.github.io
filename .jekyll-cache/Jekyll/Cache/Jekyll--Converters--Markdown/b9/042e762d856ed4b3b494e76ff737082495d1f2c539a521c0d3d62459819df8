I"<p>I am always hesitant to post such lists for two reasons: what use would it be to anyone? Its not that the things I love would also be loved by others.</p>

<p>The things we love have a potential to reveal our interiority  in a way that any biography or self-description do not.</p>

<p>Some things I love:</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Movies</strong></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Celebrities that I find inspiring</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Actress Cate Blanchett</li>
  <li>Football Manager Jurgen Klopp</li>
  <li>Philosopher Amia Srinivasan</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Music</strong></p>

<p>These fill with a sense of freedom and possibility and expansiveness. Or are associated with particular happy moments in my life.</p>

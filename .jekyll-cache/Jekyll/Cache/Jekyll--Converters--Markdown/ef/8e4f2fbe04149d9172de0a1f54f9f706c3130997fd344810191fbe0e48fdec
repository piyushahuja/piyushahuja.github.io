I"t<p>In what way am I the same person as the one who lived a few years ago? I say a few years because I cannot remember exactly how long ago it was when I first got Covid. Two years? Three years?  I have truly lost a felt sense of how far back it was.</p>

<hr />

<p>I was living in a rented room that didn’t get any sunlight.</p>

<p>I was working remotely in a programming job that I had thoroughly outgrown. It would take every ounce of my willpower to pick up a task, and not two minutes would go by that I would find my mind distracted by something else. And I was dependent on this job for my visa.</p>

<p>The pandemic and successive lockdowns had ensured that my friends were trimmed down to this one circle of Indian friends who were also new to the country.</p>

<p>I had never had any lover or girlfriend; indeed, not only had I never had sex, but I had started suspecting I was asexual.</p>

<p>I also had symptoms of depression and anxiety. I kept asking myself: “What is wrong with me?”, and came up with a growing list. I kept asking my friends: “What is wrong with me?”.</p>

<p>I researched every mental health disorder and for each one of them, at various points of time, I was convinced that I had it: from autism to narcissitic personality disorder to OCPD (which is different from OCD, that I also thought I had).</p>

<p>At one point during the middle of the first lockdown, I forgot to get out of the room for a week and couldnt sleep for days. Sleeping pills and forced morning walks only helped so much.</p>

<p>I was ordering Deliveroo twice a day. Stress eating made my weight shoot up to 90+, the heaviest I had ever been. I would be later told, by doctors who treated me for Covid, that I need to lose weight; I was clinically obese</p>

<p>The beginning of the end (of that life) happened in April 2021, when I contracted Covid. It was bad. An ambulance had to be called. I was hospitalised for ten days.  I had thoughts of death.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two months after that, in the week of my thirty-first birthday, I walked into a spiritual retreat.</p>

<p>And then, everything changed.</p>

<hr />

<p>20 months later.</p>

<p>I am permanently settled in England.</p>

<p>I have endorsement as an exceptional talent in digital technology. I have been off work since the last 10 months.</p>

<p>I live in flat. It is spacious and sunlit and I love it. I am a landlord; I two lodgers.</p>

<p>I also own a car that I love. I have been to all over England  with it. In the summer, I used it to attend summer festivals like Buddhafield, Moving Connections and the Camping seminar at Michael’s valley. It is big enough that I can sleep comfortably in it on long road trips.</p>

<p>I have a community of people all over England whom I can call upon, ask help and feedback from, and who love and accept me just as I am.</p>

<p>I am as fit as I’ve ever been and have actively partaken in sports and HIIT classes. I went bouldering. I shot clay pigeons. I joined social tennis, played squash and badminton, and attended a weekly football group. I have kayaked down the river cam.  I completed a six week course in fencing.</p>

<p>I have also taken lessons in singing and drawing, and learnt Salsa, Tango and Contact Improvisation. I joined the local 5 Rhythms community.  I used to go for improv workshops and acting classes.</p>

<p>I have taken a shot at drawing in life drawing classes. And I taught myself to cook.</p>

<p>I have reconnected with family. I visited my parents in India for a month and went on an Ayurvedic health retreat. I hosted my sister in England. I surprised her with my new life: new car, new house, new friends, as well as a ticket to retreat as a present. Ten months after she visited me, I surprised her by delivering myself at her doorstep in Warsaw.</p>

<p>I have also reconnected with Oxford: through alumni events and Christmas dinner. I reconnected with old friends: from Alex, Billy, Barbara, Sachin, Prateek.</p>

<p>I often socialise in London: from philosophy discussion in a pub, collective creativity dinner, quiz league and moving connections.</p>

<p>I know what love is. I know how to love, in all its forms: physical, energetic, heart-centred, sexual.  I have asked women out, I flirted, I wrote love letters, and, eventually, after all these years of adult life, I had lovers.</p>

<p>And, perhaps most importantly,  I love and accept myself.</p>

<p>And what is wrong with me? Mu</p>

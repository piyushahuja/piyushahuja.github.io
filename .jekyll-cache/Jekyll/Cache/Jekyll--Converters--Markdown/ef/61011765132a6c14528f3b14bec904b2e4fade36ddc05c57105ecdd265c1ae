I":<p>When I was younger, I used to read the works of great writers and feel a certain kinship to them. Reading a book, I would often go, “So true! This is how I feel as well!”. Because great writers wrote about some of the same stuff I used to think about, I would tell myself that I must be wise like them.</p>

I"><p>34 this month. It’s time to take stock.</p>

<p>This juncture of life feels crucial in a way others weren’t. It feels as if I am at a crucial bend in the road, and if I don’t maneuver it well, I could be permanenly thrown off track and derailed in many important areas of life: career, relationships, and family.  I am already late, but not too late, and this feels like a last chance to course correct.</p>

<p>In my mid 20s, I wrote down six desires I wanted to pursue. Most of them related to self-improvement: to be fitter, to be skilled, and so on. And I fulfilled most of them to a reasonable degree. <sup id="fnref:six" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:six" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>By 30, I had narrowed my desires to three: to build a company, write a novel, and have my own happy family.</p>

<p>At 33, I started a company. I got £15k Innovate UK funding. I got a £34k project.</p>

<p>What do I want now? What would happen in 30s? What am I late for?</p>

<p>I want a happy family with a wife and kid.</p>

<p>I need to find a life partner to have a child before 40.</p>

<p>What would happen in 40s?<br />
Childcare.
School costs. 
Parents. Mom and Dad in 70s/80.</p>

<p>What would happen in 50s? Health problems start creeping in. School costs.</p>

<p>What would happen at 60? Crisis. John Bosworth. Dad.</p>

      <p>I became fit to the extent that people would comment on it. I found my funny side: the most beautiful girl in my meditation retreat called me the funniest person in the group. I became a product manager and I led a product team. I learnt to code and became a senior software engineer. <a href="#fnref:six" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

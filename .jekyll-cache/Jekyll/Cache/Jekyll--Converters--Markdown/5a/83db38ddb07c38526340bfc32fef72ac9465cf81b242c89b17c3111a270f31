I"<p>pattern: I want to connect with everyone.</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you meet people when their intention is ready to receive you. You invite, suggest, nudge, say hello.  pushing or grabbing doesn’t work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a connection is not your sole responsbility: it is carried by two. There is a division of responsibility. By trying to fix a connection, doing all the work, you might “crowd out” their work, take their responsibility for them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>antidote:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learnt to listen to the body. The body is taking all kinds of signals from the environment, and it stores that knowledge. The body “knows” who accepts you and who doesn’t, regardless of how one presents themselves to you. Some of the women I felt anxious had said nothing to me, but the body “knew” that for one reason or the other, it didnt feel safe in their presence, and that caused anxiety. And often, the reason had some meat: they held a judgement about me, for example.</li>
</ul>

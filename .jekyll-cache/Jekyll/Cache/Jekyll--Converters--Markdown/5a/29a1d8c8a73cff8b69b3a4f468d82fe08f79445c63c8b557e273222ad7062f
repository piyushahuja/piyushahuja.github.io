I"å<p>34 this month, and time to take stock once again.</p>

<p>This juncture of life feels crucial in a way others werenâ€™t. It feels as if I am at a risky bend in the road, and if I donâ€™t maneuver it well, I could be forever derailed in many important areas of life: career, relationships, and family.  (I am already late, but not too late, and this feels like a last chance: it might be too late after this bend)</p>

<p>First. Career seems to be slipping away.</p>

<p>At Sixty. John Bosworth. Dad. No one would hire me.</p>

<p>Relationship. 34. I should marry in one or two years, but I am so far from finding anyone.</p>

<p>What happens? Women go through post partum depression.</p>

<p>Childcare requires one parent full time.</p>

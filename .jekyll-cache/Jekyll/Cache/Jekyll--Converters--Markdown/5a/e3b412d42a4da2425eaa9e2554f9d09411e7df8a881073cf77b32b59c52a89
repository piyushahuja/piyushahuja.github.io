I"Ê<p>Note: As of 2025, my thoughts on this have changed, more in line with Footnote (4). Winning, as I understand it now, requires treating yourself neither as an underdog nor as an overdog, but a true appraisal  of your feelings, your abilities, your environment, and your opponent at the present moment. This requires self-awareness, vulnerability, honesty, self respect, and so on. With this comes acceptance, relaxation, and energy that sets you free.</p>

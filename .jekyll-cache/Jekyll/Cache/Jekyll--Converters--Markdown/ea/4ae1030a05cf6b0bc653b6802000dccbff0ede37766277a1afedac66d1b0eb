I"õ<p>They love meâ€¦they love me not.</p>

<p>I feel by now I have a pretty good handle on the question. I donâ€™t have to pick the petals of a poor flower: my body could tell.</p>

<p>â€œYou sort of knowâ€¦donâ€™t youâ€ said my friend Dawne. The idea wafted through my skeptical mind and struck a chord with the same area where the knowingness resided: my gut.</p>

<p>This is my attempt to reflect on the times Iâ€™ve been wrong, if I ever have been, and how to tell one from the other.</p>

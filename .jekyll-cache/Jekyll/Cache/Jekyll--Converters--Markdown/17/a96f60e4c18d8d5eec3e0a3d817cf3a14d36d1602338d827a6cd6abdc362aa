<p>Walks</p>

<p>Around The Back</p>

<p>The Backs For a beautiful walk incorporating the university buildings and their impeccably manicured lawns, the River Cam and its various bridges, take a stroll along The Backs. With grazing cattle to be spotted all along this picturesque stretch of reclaimed land, this is a cracking angle from which to admire those colleges that touch the water’s edge.</p>

<p>If the colleges are closed you can walk over the river at Garret Hostel Bridge, then down ‘the Backs’ to see the backs of the colleges and up to Queens college where you can see the mathematical bridge.There is a good amount of the city you can walk around seeing the colleges without having to enter a college. Six restaurant is high up in Varsity hotel so you get a great view over the rooftops</p>

<p>You can do a nice loop through as many or as few colleges as you like from Magdalene, along the backs (which are stunning, especially in the magic hour), over the Silver Street bridge, through Pembroke and up to Emma/Downing. Also, no tourist ever really makes it out that way, but Newnham is really close to the centre and is absolutely beautiful to walk around (if you can ignore the building work, aha). If it’s not dark, you can also head out over Jesus Green to the river and watch some rowing/see the colourful boathouses, before looping back into town over Midsummer Common.</p>

<p>Sitting on the wall outside the Mill with a pint in a plastic glass is one of life’s best things.
Start at the conduit head and walk to the round church, you see most of the touristy stuff in one go. Conduit, Fitzwilliam, Fitzbillies, Peterhouse, Chronophage, Eagle, Kings, Kings college chapel, Senate house, Johns, Round church
Hobson’s Conduit - the head is on Trumpington Rd at the end of Lensfield Road.</p>

<p>Bridge of Sighs</p>

<p>The Round Church Officially known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Round Church is a Grade I listed building dating back to 1130. Its beautiful rotunda structure is formed of stone. The church’s upper storey, built above the nave, has a glorious conical spire on top, making this a pretty unique space to explore.</p>

<p>Mathematical Bridge
This pretty wooden footbridge is another gorgeous spot to breathe in a little of Cambridge’s chilled-out charm. This Grade II listed building, designed by William Etheridge and built by James Essex in 1749, takes its name from the arrangement of its timbers at certain tangents to create its arching shape. There is a myth that Sir Isaac Newton built the bridge without the help of any nuts or bolts, which, though untrue, makes a cheeky anecdote to share with your travel buddy as you stroll across.
Dinky Doors Walk</p>

<p>The walk around
Grounds of Cherry Hinton Hall
Cherry Hinton Brook 
Mill Road Cemetery
Logan’s Meadow</p>

<p>Inside Colleges The classic is a walk around some of the colleges’ courts. In some colleges you pay for the entrance (King’s, St. Johns, Trinity) but don’t be fooled: the other colleges are free and as nice! Jesus, Christ (these are two separate ones :D ), Peterhouse, Pembroke, etc. Usually they only give access to two or three internal courts and to the chapel. These are usually nice sights, but if you read something about their history before going, you might complement the sight with some interesting anecdotes. Depending on when she’s visiting, check which colleges are open to visitors - the Fellows garden at Clare is beautiful. Most of the big colleges (Clare, trinity, johns, kings, Jesus etc) have a couple of evensongs during the week. Just need to find one that’s on the night you’re around. They’re free for anyone to attend. Even if you’re not religious, they’re pretty amazing to go to once. </p>

<p>Emmanuel college is really chill about people wandering in to look round, and has loos that are closer to the bus station than the Grand Arcade. Might be nice to go to an evensong in one of the chapels. Eg http://www.clare.cam.ac.uk/Chapel-and-Choir/</p>

<p>Kings College Evensong (Cambridge Prank…) </p>

<p>Widely believed to be one of England’s finest examples of Perpendicular Gothic architecture, along with the beautiful St George’s Chapel in Windsor, King’s College Cambridge is a breathtaking place to be. With the largest fan-vaulted ceiling in the world and some dazzling examples of medieval stained glass, you’ll find yourself gazing heaven-wards to drink in its daunting beauty.</p>

<hr />

<p>Punting (to Grantchester)
Students and tourists often travel from Cambridge by punt to picnic in the meadows or take tea at The Orchard. The footpath to Cambridge that runs beside Grantchester Meadows[6] is nicknamed the Grantchester Grind.  bring a bottle of wine or some hot chocolate, absolutely the best way to see the beautiful college backs. </p>

<p>This activity was introduced to Cambridge at the start of the 20th century and entails propelling a shallow-bottomed boat with a square bow (a punt) using a wooden pole tipped with a metal “foot”. By the colleges the Cam’s riverbed is shallow and gravelly, and it won’t take long to get the hang of the activity, so long as you can avoid the many other punters taking part in summer.</p>

<p>If you’d prefer some solitude you can go a mile or two upriver, past the weir to the village of Grantchester. The backdrop here is more rural, and you can reward yourself with a pub lunch before floating back towards Cambridge.</p>

<p>Picnic on River Cam riverbanks, cross King’s College Bridge</p>

<p>Drinks on the roof top at The Varsity - the views are fantastic (and the cocktails are pretty good too).</p>

<p>Houghton Boats, SUP Cambridge for hiring SUPs, punts, canoes, kayaks</p>

<p>Wild Swimming: I discovered Houghton Mill in the summer as a good wild swimming spot
Another similar spot I discovered recently is St Helen’s Picnic Site in Thetford Forest, if you’re ever out that way. Although no boating. Lovely water (although a bit shallower than HM) and greats walks. There’s a beautiful tiny church there too</p>

<p>A Day at Botanical Garden</p>

<p>Ice skating on Parker’s Piece. </p>

<p>ADC Theatre
There is a cheap, but always VERY good, theatre run by students, with two venues: the ADC theatre and the Corpus Playroom. During Christmas they do smaller (outsourced) productions: I have never been at one of those so I’m not sure about their quality. The theatre and its companies are also renowned for their prominent history and alumni.</p>

<p>DNA Bike Path
 </p>

<p>Visit Ely This one isn’t technically in Cambridge, but it makes for a brilliant day trip during your stay. Dating back to 1083, it is built in the monumental Romanesque style and its central octagonal tower attracts some 250,000 visitors every year. Take a moment to gaze up at the church’s captivating ceilings and dazzling stained glass.
 
A Day at the University Library</p>

<p>Live Music: Try The Portland Arms. Check what gigs are coming up. The Blue Moon is also OK for nightlife, as is Q Club on certain nights. The night scene can seem fairly limited in Cambridge. A cafe/bar called CB2 also has some good live events in the basement downstairs.</p>

<p>Shops, Cafes</p>

<p>Harry Potter: A small one would be to visit the (semi)-secret Harry Potter shop in the tourist information center. It’s pretty cool if you’re into the wizarding world</p>

<p>Waterstones Cafe</p>

<p>The Granta on the fen is a really lovely pub to watch the sun set, and 
Fort St George by the river is a nice spot to watch the rowers go up and down if you’re so inclined. Both do good food.
Pho Vietnamese</p>

<p>Bakery near Grafton</p>

<p>Crepe Affaire is amazing, not quite pancakes but so so good. It’s near the historical Round Church. Perfect spot for brunch babe</p>

<p>Parker’s Tavern</p>

<p>Fitzbillies
Definitely the highest calorie thing to do in Cambridge is to drop into the gorgeous Fitzbillies on Trumpington Street and feast on one of their famous Chelsea Buns. These sticky-sweet snacks have been on sale here since 1921 and make for an ideal riverside energy boost when your punting enthusiasm begins to wane. There’s now a second branch of Fitzbillies on Bridge Street serving coffees, cakes and tasty bacon rolls.</p>

<p>Cambridgeshire Wine School
If fine wines are your thing, head along to Cambridgeshire Wine School for a lively evening of wine tasting. Not only will you sample delightful wines from Europe and even further afield, you’re bound to make some fabulous new friends, too. Choose evenings dedicated to Italian tipples, South American or Portuguese recipes. There’s even a cheese and wine event if you’re a fan of fancy fromage.
hot numbers on Gwydir Street off Mill Road and watch jazz
Best place for beer selection is down the same street as Hot Numbers. Its a pub called the Cambridge Blue and I highly recommend it for its vast selection.</p>

<p>Museums</p>

<p>Fitzwilliam Museum. The brilliantly diverse collection includes arms, coins, Cypriot, Greek and Egyptian art by Degas, Reubens and Gainsborough among countless others. Many consider it the finest small museum in all of Europe</p>

<p>Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences</p>

<p>The collections at the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology cover nearly two million years of human history and come from all six of the world’s inhabited continents.</p>

<p>The museum goes back to 1884 and moved into purpose-built premises in 1913, refurbished and reopened in 2013 on its centenary.</p>

<p>Some of the most captivating things to see are the ethnographic pieces picked up by the explorer Captain James Cook during his three expeditions in the 18th century.</p>

<p>There are also Roman and Anglo-Saxon artefacts unearthed in digs around Cambridge and East Anglia, while the oldest item is a stone tool discovered in Tanzania’s Olduvai Gorge and dating back 1.8 million years.</p>

<p>One exhibit that literally stands out is the towering 19th-century Haida totem pole from Tanu in British Columbia.</p>

<p>If this list has already got you thinking Cambridge rocks, let us dig a little deeper and recommend you a geology museum that’s pure gold. (Thanks. We know.) The oldest of Cambridge University’s museums, it was founded in 1728 and is now home to around two million minerals, fossil and rocks.
Corpus Clock. With a face made entirely of gold, a metal grasshopper called the Chronophage or ‘time-eater’ sitting above it and an undulating ripple design, which suggests the expansion of the universe after the Big Bang</p>

<p>The Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) was founded in 1920 as a memorial to Captain Robert Falcon Scott and his team, who died in 1912 in Antarctica on the return trek from the South Pole.</p>

<p>The SPRI runs the museum at the institute at the building, recording the feats achieved during the “Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration”. The museum has photographs, pieces of archive footage, drawings and paintings.</p>

<p>You can view arts and crafts by people indigenous to the Arctic, as well as equipment from polar expeditions and the last letters written by Scott during his ill-fated trek</p>

<p>ree to enter, the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences is Cambridge’s oldest museum and was created when the geologist John Woodward bequeathed his collection of fossils to the university in 1728. Some of Woodward’s fossils can still be viewed in their original 18th-century cabinets.</p>

<p>In all the museum has about two million rock, fossil and mineral specimens.</p>

<p>Standing guard by the entrance to the museum is Iggy the Iguanodon, the plaster replica of a dinosaur skeleton discovered in a mine in 1878, and was donated to the museum by the King of Belgium in 1878. Also fascinating is the set of 2,000 rocks and fossils gathered by Charles Darwin during his expedition on the HMS Beagle, and there are also numerous meteorites, each presented with a thin section showing their optical properties.</p>

<p>The biggest aviation museum in Britain is at a former RAF base 10 miles south of Cambridge.</p>

<p>There are five hangars, including the recently extended “Hangar 1”, which houses more than 30 aircraft starting with the First World War.</p>

<p>In Hangar 2 you can see planes that are in working order, and watch restoration work in progress, while Hangar 3 combines naval aircraft and vessels and Hangar 4 is devoted to the Battle of Britain during the Second World War.</p>

<p>Beyond all this you can enter Duxford’s preserved Operations Room, check out the tanks, artillery and armoured cars in the Land Warfare Hall and marvel at the B-52 and Blackbird in the American Air Museum.</p>

<p>Imperial War Museum As well as an enormous airfield, this museum also boasts a collection of 200 vintage aircraft (including Concorde and the Spitfire) which have been carefully restored to their hey-day glory and are displayed proudly from floor to ceiling at what is the largest aviation museum in Europe.</p>

<p>There are several museums that are free to enter. The museum of Natural Sciences, the museum of Zoology, the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. They are all located in Downing Street and each one takes just one hour to visit. I particularly like the Zoology one, that has also a nice cafeteria.</p>

<p>Kettle’s Yard For a sprinkle of culture, head along to Kettle’s Yard, a gorgeous Cambridge house filled with a collection of 20th-century art, which also has its own contemporary gallery. There are exhibitions on display for much of the year and events including study days, art workshops and music recitals.</p>

<p>do go to Kettle’s yard! It’s a “house museum” (free but you should book your slot in advance). It was owned by an art lover and expert who collected proper masterpieces and put them in his place. It’s different from any other art museum you can visit (at least, that I visited!) and it leaves you in awe!</p>

<p>The collector and first modern art curator of the Tate Gallery, Jim Ede lived at this property on Castle Street in the 20th century.</p>

<p>Kettle’s Yard is made up of four separate cottages joined together, and every afternoon Ede and his wife Helen would open their house to visitors to give a tour of his collection.</p>

<p>The home and all its art were donated to the University of Cambridge in the 60s and the layout, books, home furnishings and laidback atmosphere are all holdovers from when the Edes were here.</p>

<p>The collection is a who’s who of the British avant-garde in the first decades of the 20th century and has works by Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and David Jones, but also Joan Miró, Helen Frankenthaler and Henri Gaudier-Brzeska.</p>

<p>Request:</p>

<p>I’m looking for places to go in a day, leaving from Cambridge and let’s say up to 15 kms away. Ideally some sort of park or point of view as the destination, and heading outside the city. We’ll be taking the kids on our cargo bike, so roads with bike paths are preferred. As an example I’ve taken the kids to campus by bike before and the mix of small roads/bike paths was ok.</p>

<p>Ickworth is nice for kids to visit but is national trust so you will have to book on Friday when they release tickets (if you are a member) https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/ickworth</p>

<p>Also you can cycle around fulbourn nature reserve and local villages are quite nice 
https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/local/fulbourn-fen-south-cambridgeshire</p>

<p>Fen Drayton Lakes area is pretty nice. Easy riding along the busway to get there and nice little walks around lakes and things once you are in the area. lots of bird life so bring binoculars! https://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/reserves-a-z/fen-drayton-lakes/</p>

<p>I have also heard there are some cycle routes around wimpole estate but might be all cycling on major roads to get there unfortunately.
https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/features/cycle-at-wimpole-estate-cambridgeshire</p>

<p>I quite like cycling over the river at the green dragon bridge, then along the river to the north, then it looks like you can cut across to milton country park for some walks coffee/gelato at the cafe. </p>

<p>Wandelbury
According to their website, Wandlebury is still open &amp; the cycle path on the pavement extends all the way up the hill (A1307)…although I imagine it’s a bit busy.</p>

<p>To add to the comment above about Wandlebury, I have been there on several occasions and yes it is open and great to cycle/walk in. There have been a few people there, but I would not call it ‘busy’ - loads of space for kids to play around. I thoroughly recommend it. 
I’d second this; it’s cycle-able from cambridge (the last hill is a bit steep if you’re not used to it!) and biking means you don’t have to pay an entry fee. Look out for the Dinky Door!</p>

<p>We often go to Fulbourn Fen (off Stonebridge Lane) for a walk….woods with an odd mix of pasture in the middle &amp; access to Fleam Dyke. 
You might be able to get to the sawston oasis. 
Head down the DNA cycle path, go through Stapleford and by the road. Just on your right</p>

<p>The guided bus route to the north of the city goes through a pleasant bird sanctuary with some walking around space. There is some bike parking. But there is (apart from a few car crossings) a vehicle free path. It’s about 10 miles (I have done it a few times on my (non-electric) Winther Kangaroo. The pathway from Milton Road and Kings hedges is so nice, it’s where I’ve been teaching my eldest to ride.
Fleam Dyke.</p>

<p>Also consider Wicken fen as somewhere to go to get out of town. Not really buildings as destinations, but some options.</p>

<p>Bartlow hill is nice spot, we recently visited on bike.
http://thelostbyway.com/2016/05/pyramids-essex-bartlow-hills.html</p>

<p>Wandlebury is quite easily accessible on a continuous bike path along Babraham Rd and has a little tadpole pond, a den building area, some tree trunks to climb on and sometimes cows on a meadow to watch. The kids I have been there with greatly enjoyed the place.</p>

<p>Milton Country Park is a nice bike ride along the river (you could also go all the way to Waterbeach which I heard is nice, too, but have never been myself so far), however, there are two large ponds and I don’t know how old your children are and if you are comfortable with large accessible water bodies around them ;-)</p>

<p>We discovered some nice bike routes, from the city centre to Fen Ditton and from the city centre to Waterbeach, both along or close to the Cam. Also via Trumpington into the Grantchester meadows and back to Cambridge.</p>

<p>The grounds around Wimpole Hall are lovely, here’s a page discussing the various routes to cycle there: https://www.camcycle.org.uk/newsletters/105/article11.html</p>

<p>There is also a new multi use trail around Wimpole Hall estate. https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wimpole-estate/features/wimpoles-proposed-multi-use-trail . Ridden on 24th June and is open as a circular route.</p>

<p>You could cycle to Wandlebury. There’s a cycle path along the A1307 from the Addenbrooke’s roundabout to the entrance. It’s uphill from Addenbrookes on the way there but then you get a nice downhill cycle on the way back.</p>

<p>There’s also a nice cycle from the Stapleford Granary (I’m assuming you know how to get that far from Cambridge). If you turn into the granary and follow the track, it ends up in Babraham but before that, there’s a bridge/river where kids can paddle, fish, etc. The track is quite gravelly and it’s narrow near the bridge so I’m not sure how easy it would be for a cargo bike but it’s lovely if you can make it that far.</p>

<p>I bookmarked this page a while ago: https://www.komoot.com/guide/17345/road-cycling-routes-in-cambridgeshire. There might be something there of interest.
I noticed that route 8 mentions the Old Butchers cafe/shop in Balsham. They are currently open (June 2020) &amp; have been advertising their recent acquisition of a soft-serve ice cream machine.</p>

<p>Brook Leys parkland, https://eddington-cambridge.co.uk/explore/parks-and-open-spaces</p>

<p>Anglesey Abbey, https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/anglesey-abbey-gardens-and-lode-mill</p>

<p>Have you tried the cycle path along the guided busway that connects Cambridge and St Ives? It is off-traffic the whole route and reasonably flat in its 10 miles. http://www.gps-routes.co.uk/routes/home.nsf/RoutesLinksWalks/cambridge-to-st-ives-along-the-busway-walking-and-cycle-route#</p>

<p>A closer destination is Grantchester, where you can get following the river from Grantchester Meadows. </p>

<p>Further away I like to cycle to the Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve. The roads a quiet but is not strictly on bike paths.</p>

<p>How about Cambridge to St. Ives via the https://www.thebusway.info/, and couple of miles further (if you have energy) there’s https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/houghton-mill-and-waterclose-meadows -  a nice mill you can visit and a very nice river kids can splash in.
St. Ives is 12 miles from North Cambridge via the guided busway - it may be a bit further than you’d want to cycle..</p>

<p>The Roman Road from Fulbourn to Horseheath is a great walking and cycling path, though it’s borderline with a cargo bike and young kids. Entry point on google maps is marked on https://www.google.com/maps/search/roman+road+near+Fulbourn,+Cambridge/@52.1599457,0.1919989,15.46z
There’s also nice information on https://frrfd.org.uk/ , though they make it sound and look like it’s only walkable.</p>

<p>https://www.cyclestreets.net - a useful planner</p>

<p>https://www.alltrails.com/england</p>

<p>https://slowways.uk/ they have a UK-wide map for walking and cycling routes.</p>

<p>One website/app I can thoroughly recommend is Komoot - it’s basically a collection of good running/cycling/hiking routes. </p>

<p>https://www.komoot.com/guide/670893/road-cycling-routes-around-cambridge</p>

<p>I did the 6th route on that page, “Lovely view loop from Cambridge”, and it was a great ride.
It’s good as you know the routes are tried and tested by cyclists, so it won’t kick you onto a highway as Google Maps sometimes does! </p>

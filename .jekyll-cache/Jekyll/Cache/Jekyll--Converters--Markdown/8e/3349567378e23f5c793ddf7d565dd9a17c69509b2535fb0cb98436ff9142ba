I"c<p>They love me…they love me not.</p>

<p>By now I have a pretty good handle on the question. I don’t have to pick the petals of a poor flower: my body could tell.</p>

<p>“<em>You sort of know…don’t you”</em> said my friend Dawne. That you just <em>know</em> whether you’d hit it off with someone - pre-communication, pre-familiarity, pre- any dating rituals - was an idea that wafted through my skeptical mind - completely bypassed it - and struck a chord in the same area where the knowingness resided. It was true and I just knew it.</p>

<p>But have there been times when I sort of “just knew” that I am not loved, but eventually I was? When my gut instinct has been wrong?</p>

<p>This is my attempt to reflect on the times I’ve felt loved, or acutely felt the absence of it, and everything in between.</p>

<p>The first signal was in the m/w reunion. I was looking at her, but she wasn’t looking for me. And I was suddenly overcome by feeling of grief, with memories of all those times when I imagine being loved but the reality swerves differently. “She doesn’t love me”. “I’ll never be loved”</p>

<p>Eventually, I sorted myself out and mustered the strength to meet her. When we hugged, she said, “you’re my favourite Indian man here” (I was the only Indian).</p>

<p>She spent the closing with Simon.</p>

<p>At the parting, she mentioned she was going to meet “someone special”.</p>

<p>I was her second pick. I wasn’t her desire: I was her safety.</p>

<p>Seven months after that, we became lovers.</p>

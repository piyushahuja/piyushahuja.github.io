<hr />

<p>in every interaction, look for aliveness. this is where a personâ€™s energy come out: excitement, anger, passion. do it for both yourself and the other. bring that out. expand on it.</p>

<p>a lot of effort into controlling their energy: not being too loud or moving too weirdly, being â€œtoo muchâ€.</p>

<p>aliveness is when you allow the energy to discharge naturally, the way a small child would. we learn to â€˜behaveâ€™ to avoid shame. we forget how to be comfortable in our skin. children are our teachers in so many ways.</p>

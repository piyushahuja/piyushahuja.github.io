I"°<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9m7saxzv-Q">A day in the of Abbey Road</a></p>

<p>This is one of those meaningfully silly-but-fun things you can do with your friends. I still reminisce with fondness the two times Iâ€™ve been here, whereas the experiences of art galleries, monuments and museum tours Iâ€™ve largely forgotten. There is an unadulterated romance to the place. It hasnâ€™t sold off to the tourism industry or modern day capitalism. Itâ€™s neither advertised nor commercialised. You wouldnâ€™t find people trying to sell it to you. Or sell stuff to you when youâ€™re there. It is just a zebra crossing. A zebra crossing imbued with aesthetic meaning, connecting people across time and distance, across generations and geographies. And everyone who visits has their own personal connection with Abbey Road.</p>

This is when life mimics are. There is no fabrication or artifice. The first time I was here Platform 9 3/4 Quarters at St. Cross would come a close second, whereas 221 b Baker Street is now a full museuem with ticket prices and shit, and dont even get me started on the prices that football clubs (read â€˜profit hungry business venturesâ€™) chargee.  -->

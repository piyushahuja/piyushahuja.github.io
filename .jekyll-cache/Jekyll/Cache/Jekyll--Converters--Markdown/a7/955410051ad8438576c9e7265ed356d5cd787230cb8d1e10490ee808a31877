  <p>One measure of how good the writing is is how little effort it requires for the reader to track whatâ€™s going on. For example, I am not an absolute believer in standard punctuation at all times, but one thing thatâ€™s often a big shock to my students is that punctuation isnâ€™t merely a matter of pacing or how you would read something out loud. These marks are, in fact, cues to the reader for how very quickly to organize the various phrases and clauses of the sentence so the sentence as a whole makes sense.</p>

  <p>I believe psycholinguists, as part of neuro-science, spend . . . I mean, they hook little sensors up to readersâ€™ eyes and study this stuff. I donâ€™t know much about that, but I do know that when youâ€™re not punctuating effectively for your genre, or when you fail to supply sufficient transitions, you are upping the amount of effort the reader has to make in order . . . forget appreciate . . . simply to understand what it is that you are communicating. My own guess is that at just about the point where that amountâ€” the amount of time that youâ€™re spending on a sentence, the amount of effortâ€” becomes conscious, when you are conscious that this is hard, is the time when college studentsâ€™ papers begin getting marked down by the prof.

<p>First, letâ€™s look at the often-confusing comma. It isnâ€™t easy holding complex sentences together (just ask a conjunction or a subordinate), but the clever little comma can help lighten the load. How can you tell whether a comma is really needed? Terisa Folaron offers some tricks of the comma trade in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHnl1O3NGJk&amp;t=2s">this TED-Ed Lesson</a>.</p>

<p>What about the Oxford comma? If you read â€œBob, a DJ and a clownâ€ on a guest list, are three people coming to the party or only one? That depends on whether youâ€™re for or against the most hotly-contested punctuation mark of all time. When do we use one? Can it really be optional, or is there a universal rule? In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptM7FzyjtRk">this lesson</a>, TED-Ed explores both sides of this comma conundrum.</p>

<p>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/holy-writ?Src=longreads</p>

<p>â€œEve was across the room in a thin, burgundy dress that showed the faint outline of her stomach.â€</p>

<p>Usage guides say that if you can substitute â€œandâ€ for the comma it belongs there.Â 
Â Bryan Garner, the expert in American usage, offers another test: reverse the order of the adjectives. Would you ever say â€œa burgundy, thin dressâ€? I wouldnâ€™t.</p>

<p>No brackets.</p>

<p>Like â€œthing,â€ parentheses only weaken what you actually want to say. If you want to say it, say it. If not, donâ€™t.</p>

<p>Whether itâ€™s the brackets that are unnecessary or whatâ€™s in them is for you to decide. But one of the two is. At least 99% of the time.</p>

<p>Probability is on your side when you ditch them.</p>

<p>Before: â€œYou must pass a (ridiculously hard) course.â€</p>

<p>After: â€œYou must pass a ridiculouslyÂ hard course.â€</p>

<hr />

<p>My recommendations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use ellipsis to indicate tht part of a quotation is missing: â€œWe the people of the United States of America â€¦ promote the general welfare â€¦â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use ellipsis (or dashes) to suggest an interruption in dialogue: â€œI love you, Clara,â€ he said, looking into her eyes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>â€œI â€¦â€ she stopped. Did she love him or not?</p>

<p>â€œYou donâ€™t have to say it.â€</p>

<p>â€œNo!â€ She told him, shaking her head violently from side to side. â€œI want to say it. I really do! Itâ€™s just that â€¦ Oh my God! Why did you take your pants off?â€</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use ellipsis (orâ€etc.â€ or â€œand so onâ€) to indicate an unfinished sequence: â€œShe loved everything ghoulish: monsters, zombies, blood, torture devices, beheadings â€¦â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not use ellipsis to indicate a casual, folksy, stream-of-consciousness point-of-view. Youâ€™ll wind up catching a bad case of dot-itis: â€œSo â€¦ the other day, I was talking to Bill â€¦ and we kinda decided to murder his cousin â€¦â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not use them as a way of avoiding the commitment of periods, question marks, commas, semi-colons, and exclamation marks. Readers will not necessarily understand what youâ€™re trying to convey, and dots will crop up all over your prose like weeds: â€œI was talking to my Mom the other day â€¦ about what I should do for a career â€¦ she suggested Journalism â€¦ I donâ€™t know â€¦ I kind of want to be a mortician â€¦â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not use ellipsis because youâ€™d rather not figure out which more-appropriate punctuation symbol to use. Readers wonâ€™t be fooled. They wonâ€™t think youâ€™re â€œjust musing.â€ Theyâ€™ll assume you donâ€™t know how to punctuate: â€œWhat should I say to my boyfriend â€¦ he wants to break up â€¦ but I think we should stay together â€¦ what do you think â€¦â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not use ellipsis as an attempt to inject profundity into your writing. Three dots do not make â€œLife sucks and then you dieâ€¦â€ more deep than â€œLife sucks and then you die.â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not use ellipsis to â€œwiselyâ€ and â€œcoylyâ€ suggest, â€œâ€¦ think about it,â€ as if youâ€™re winking and tapping the side of your nose (or stroking your beard). You canâ€™t effectively hedge profundity: â€œYou didnâ€™t like it? Well â€¦ thatâ€™s okay â€¦ I was just rambling â€¦ It wasnâ€™t supposed to be pheeelosophy or anything â€¦ Oh, wait â€¦ what? â€¦ you did like it? Well, then â€¦ just goes to show you â€¦ sometimes rambling can contain a grain â€¦ just a tad â€¦ just a smidgen â€¦ of wisdom â€¦â€</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In English, parenthesis (which I learned (from a comment) is what this question is really asking about) indicate an asideâ€“a sidetrack from the main point the sentence is making. In most cases, you could remove the parenthetical phrase and the sentence would still make sense: â€œIn English, parenthesis indicate an asideâ€“a sidetrack from the main point the sentence is making.â€</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>My mother (gotta love her!) called me at 3am this morning.</p>

<p>I would like a steak (medium rare), mashed potatoes (with butter), and a slice of pie (apple, cherry, or rhubarb).</p>

<p>When Marsha (who looked just like her sister, Nancy, only taller and with slightly graying hair) looked Peter (her lawyerâ€™s son) in his (piercing blue) eyes, she saw he was lost, as most young men are at that age (even if theyâ€™ve be raised by urban sophisticates), so (on an impulse) she leaned over and gave him a (chaste) kiss on the forehead, which he remembered for the rest of his (sadly short) life.</p>

<p>Some writers invert the relationship, making the parenthetical phrase the most important point in the sentence. (As I did this at the end of the last paragraph, with â€œ(sadly short).â€) This creates an ironic twist, in which the grammatical structure is saying one thing, but the subtext is saying the opposite. Itâ€™s like when you realize a person nervous by his body language, even though his words evoke confidence.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>I would never cheat on my wife (unless I could so without getting caught).</p>

<p>There are other ironic uses, such as this famous one by Vladimir Nabokov, from Lolita:</p>

<p>My very photogenic mother died in a freak accident (picnic, lightning) when I was three, and, save for a pocket of warmth in the darkest past, nothing of her subsists within the hollows and dells of memory, over which, if you can still stand my style (I am writing under observation), the sun of my infancy had set: surely, you all know those redolent remnants of day suspended, with the midges, about some hedge in bloom or suddenly entered and traversed by the rambler, at the bottom of a hill, in the summer dusk; a furry warmth, golden midges.
On a literal level, Nabokov is playing by the rules. You could cut â€œ(picnic, lightening)â€ and â€œ(I am writing under observation)â€ from the sentence, and it would still make sense. And yet those asides call more attention to themselves than the â€œmain points.â€ They make you want to say, â€œWait! Wait! Back up! Tell me more about the picnic and the observation!â€</p>

<p>There are several ways to indicate an aside in Englishâ€“and probably in most other languagesâ€“and each has a slightly different feel, though this is somewhat based on each readerâ€™s individual perception, and this (along with other forms of punctuation) gives writers a nuanced utility belt. As I indicated in the previous sentence, the three main aside-markers are dashes, commas, and parenthesis.</p>

<p>Dashes loudly proclaim the beginning and ending of the aside. Theyâ€™re like saying, â€œBy they wayâ€¦â€ Commas do it gently, folding the aside in with the rest of the sentence, almost masking the fact that it is an aside. Parenthesis, like dashes, clearly mark the aside, but with more of a whisper than a bang.</p>

<p>I know this question is about poetry and Iâ€™ve only mentioned prose so far. But, in my experience, asides work the same way in either form. Some poets experiment and veer far away from standard usage, so itâ€™s possible youâ€™ll run across one with ((((quirks like this)))) in it, but some prose writers experiment, too, and itâ€™s possible youâ€™ll run across )))this((( in a novel. There are no rules. Writing is what you have the audacity to try and what you can get away with.</p>

Are you asking whether written questions confuse readers if they donâ€™t end in a question mark. Do ducks quack. Is rain wet.</p>

<p>Most readers will understand the three questions, above, just as they will understand the meaning of the following sentence: mi d0gg haz fl33s. Itâ€™s, amazing, how, many, rules, of, grammar, schpellingk, and, punc!utation, you, can, brake, and, still, be, underst,,,andable! Y cn wrt sntncs wtht vwls!</p>

<p>The downside of using non-traditional punctuation, besides getting a slap on the wrist from an editor or English teacher, is that it slows readers down. They have a momentary bout of cognitive dissonance, in which they wonder if theyâ€™ve misread something or if youâ€™ve made a mistake. This puts a hurdle between the point youâ€™re trying to make and the readerâ€™s understanding of it. In most cases, readers can leap over the hurdle, but why make them do it in the first place? Why. Why. Why.</p>

<hr />

<p>Why do poets sometimes include lines within brackets in their poems?</p>

<p>Can the interrobang [â€½] symbol be used in everyday writing? If so how?

I wouldnâ€™t, because my goal when writing is to communicate ideas as clearly as possible and to evoke sensations as strongly as possible. Confusion tends to work against those goals (unless Iâ€™m trying to evoke a sensation of confusion), and most people, having never seen an interrobang before, will simply be confused by it.</p>

<p>Even if they figure out its meaning by context, their momentary confusion will blunt the effect.</p>

<p>And I canâ€™t think of any function an interrobang serves that I canâ€™t easily evoke via some less-obscure means.</p>

No thought you can think

Your essence

Yet it is the foundations for all that moves

Rest in the shimmering emptiness
That is the source of the world

<p>I have to be somewhere where I desire something. To get it, I have to be someone, so the thought goes. What is that someone?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I could be spiritual, like a stoic monk.</li>
  <li>I could be generous and giving, as if I were in service.</li>
  <li>I could be outspoken and attention-seeking.</li>
  <li>I could be vulnerable and speak my thoughts, often insecurities.</li>
  <li>I could be vulnerable and keep track of my feelings and vocalise them as they arise.</li>
  <li>I could be ‚Äúin my power‚Äù: outspoken and status seeking, as a way of channeling eros.</li>
  <li>I could be playful and humorous, as it provides comfort, flexibility and makes others feel safe.</li>
  <li>I could follow rules of behavior I have learnt: about yes/no, needs, wants and boundaries.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

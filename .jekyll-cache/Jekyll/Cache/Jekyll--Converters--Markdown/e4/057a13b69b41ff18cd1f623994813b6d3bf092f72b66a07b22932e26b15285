<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Speed</strong>: isolated, consistent and repeatable environments
for your developers to fire up a new version of the application that a collogue may have written requires muddling around in Git and using branches ‚Äì this interrupts work flows and can lead to lose of work if ‚Äúgit stash‚Äù isn‚Äôt used right. With a container: they just run it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Portability</strong>: Docker images define abstract and immutable run time environment independent of the underlying hardware platform and packages it into a well defined and efficient image specification. With Dockerhub, we have a global distribution network
First up: portability and allowing anyone, on any hardware, and any OS to run the application with a single command. All they need to do is install Docker and ‚Äúdocker run‚Äù will do the rest. With a TAR file based deployment, they need TAR, they need to know how-to deploy the application and manage the files; they may need some runtime on their system like Ruby, Python or NodeJS; and they cannot restrict the resources the application is using‚Ä¶</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Simplifies your infrastructure requirements</strong>
you can restrict the resources the application is using inside of a container much easier than you can with one that is not.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Automation</strong> is first class citizen: Dockerfile, DockerCompose
one final point here: Docker Compose. You‚Äôre missing out on a lot of free stuff here. It‚Äôs so easy to write a Docker Compose file that brings up everything needed by the application - databases, caches, mocked APIs - allowing anyone in your organisation to bring up the application on their laptop and play with it, including the CEO, DBAs, QA, the receptionist.‚Ä®</li>

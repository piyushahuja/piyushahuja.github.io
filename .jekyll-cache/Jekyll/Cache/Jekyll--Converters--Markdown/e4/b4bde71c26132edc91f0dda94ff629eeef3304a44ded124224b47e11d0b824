I"‚<p>The Problem: Alice has to send information to Bob. But the transfer should achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It should be tamper-proof. If modified it should be detected by Bob</li>
  <li>It should be private or encrypted. No one but Bob can read it. Bob should be able to decrypt it.</li>
  <li>It should be fixed length? compressed? anthing else?</li>
</ul>

<p>Hash functions are a way to make your message tamper-proof . They are one-way functions. that is, functions whose inverse is difficult to calculate.</p>

<p>Terms to understand: SHA1, SHA256, ROT13, B64 encoding, BCrypt, RSA, Diffie Helman, PGP, Public/Private keys</p>

I"â<p>Terraform is a <strong>tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently</strong>.Â  Terraform is an open source command line tool that can be used to provision any kind of infrastructure on dozens of different platforms and services.Â With Terraform you simply declare resources and how you want them configured and then Terraform will map out the dependencies and build everything for you. Â Terraform is a greatÂ infrastructure provisioning tool, but you may have noticed that it doesnâ€™t come with a config management system. We use Terraform to stand up virtual machines or cloud instances, and then we hand over the reins to Ansible to finish up the configuration of our OS and applications.</p>

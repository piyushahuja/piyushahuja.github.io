I"<p>The notion ‘public interest’ is frequently used as a justification of public policy, and advancing it is often seen as the central task of the political process.  What it refers to, however, is often vague, imprecise and unclear.  Considering the diversity in human nature, the sheer breadth of human needs and desires, wouldn’t any policy which claims to be ‘in public interest’ inevitably be against the interest of one group or another? (A road thats good for some people is a source of noise, pollution, and collision risk to others.) Consensus is a rare in almost any public policy issue, and conflicts of interest abound. What, then, is public interest?  Or is the term fraudulent, a misleading shorthand for the interest of the majority or the politically dominant group?  In this essay, I argue that it is possible to make sense of public interest, in all its various applications,  without assuming a perfectly homogenous population and without identifying the term with majoritarianism or regulatory capture.</p>

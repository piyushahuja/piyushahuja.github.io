  <p>Conflicting advice exists for a reason. Youâ€™re going to get a ton of it. What works for one company, at one stage, wonâ€™t work for another company at the same stage. â€œDonâ€™t overhireâ€ is a great mantra, until youâ€™re bottlenecking scale. Waiting for less dilution makes perfect sense until youâ€™re out of money. Figuring out whatâ€™s right for your company (and not being paralyzed by fear of being wrong if it turns out thatâ€™s the case) is the knack.</p>

I"&<p>34 this month. It’s time to take stock.</p>

<p>This juncture of life feels crucial in a way others weren’t. It feels as if I am at a crucial bend in the road, and if I don’t maneuver it well, I could be permanenly thrown off track and derailed in many important areas of life: career, relationships, and family.  I am already late, but not too late, and this feels like a last chance to course correct.</p>

<p>In my mid 20s, I wrote down six desires I wanted to pursue. Most of them related to self-improvement: to be fitter, to be skilled, and so on. And I fulfilled most of them to a reasonable degree.<sup id="fnref:six" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:six" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>By 30, I had narrowed my desires to three: to build a company, write a novel, and have my own happy family.  At 32, I bought a house. And became a landlord. At 33, I started a company. I recruited a friend and some interns. I won a competitive £15k grant. I won and fulfilled a £34k contract.</p>

<p>What do I want at 34? What do I feel I need to urgently orient towards?</p>

<p>I want a family with a life partner, children, and a comfortable home. I want children. I want a job and financial health that allows me to spend time with children, to afford childcare, to send them to good schools, and to meet other needs such as travel and coaching.</p>

<p>Ability to have children.</p>

<p>80% of people suffer from presbyopia (trouble focusing nearby items) by their mid-40s. It’s a very common part of aging and the reason why most older folks need “readers” (e.g. reading glasses). It’s just something you don’t think about until it happens to you. I’m an eye doc. It’s 99.5% of people, to varying degrees of severity. If I get you to perfect refraction at distance, you’ll need help up close. “But I see fine up close without my glasses”. Good for you, you’re a bit myopic and can do that. Only case I’ve seen that didn’t require reading glasses into their 50’s had form fruste keratoconus and basically had a nice built-in aspheric optics that gave them a bump of “plus” to assist with their near vision. I’d say that they were a product of good luck. Some people have tiny pupils and have increased depth of field, but to get there, they need good lighting. Anyway, light is your friend.</p>

      <p>I became fit to the extent that people would comment on it. I found my funny side: the most beautiful girl in my meditation retreat called me the funniest person in the group. I became a product manager and I led a product team. I learnt to code and became a senior software engineer. <a href="#fnref:six" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

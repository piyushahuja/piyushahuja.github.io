<p>The things we love can reveal aspects of our interior lives  in a way that any biography or self-description cannot.</p>

<p><strong>Movies</strong></p>

<p>I am cinephile. I often re-watch movies I like multiple times.</p>

<p>I enjoy movies directed by Wes Anderson and Hayao Miyazaki (Studio Ghibli). I like movies that are thought-provoking, have a feeling of openness and expansiveness, or a fresh perspective on old motifs.</p>

<p>Some of my other favorite movies: Contact, Eternal Sunshine on the Spotless Mind, Carol, Finding Forrester, The Truman Show, Proof, Blade Runner, The Matrix, The Social Network, Starter For Ten, Taare Zameen Par, Lakshya</p>

<p>I once sat down and listed all the movies I like, and found some patterns. It seems I might have a soft spot for the following themes:</p>

<p>• coming-of-age (Brooklyn, Lakshya, An Education, Starter For Ten)
• authentic middle-class family relationships (An Education, Almost Famous, A Separation, Taare Zameen Par, Fantastic Mr. Fox)
• meritocratic rise of an underdog (Contact, Finding Forrester, Forrest Gump, La La Land, Proof, A Beautiful Mind, Goal).
• space travel (Contact, Interstellar, Gravity)
• death and the human condition (The Fountain, The Man From Earth)</p>

<p>I would love any recommendations based on this list!</p>

<p><strong>Music</strong></p>

<p>These fill with a sense of freedom and possibility and expansiveness. Or are associated with particular happy moments in my life.</p>

I"ø<p>There is a â€œway of beâ€ in the world that is tantric.</p>

<p>It is non-reactive and relaxed.
It feels effortless, free, in the â€œflow of lifeâ€, genuine, authentic, â€œin integrityâ€.
All emotions are welcome, including: fear, anger, sadness (to investigate: what about â€œstressâ€, â€œanxietyâ€, â€œnervousnessâ€, â€œjealousyâ€). 
It has heightened awareness of your own emotions, your senses. 
You see reality â€œas isâ€, including the emotions of others. 
You have needs, but you are not â€œneedyâ€. You are not in a â€œgettingâ€ state. 
You give freeily, but do not â€œgive to getâ€.
You are able to play and take risks.</p>

<p>Often I criticize myself for not being socially savvy, for not being able to make small talk or have conversations with beautiful women. But the reason I feel uncomfortable to talk to certain woman have nothing to do with ability, but often about the cues that I have picked subconsciously picked up up on how the other personâ€™s attitutde towards me.</p>

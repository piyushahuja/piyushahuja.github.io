I"L7<p>lick the reader all over, soaking him with spit</p>

<p>Next, writers should understand that it’s much easier to make readers have sensory experiences than feelings or ideas. Whenever possible, writers should use that to their advantage. An essay on democracy will benefit from descriptions of flipping switches inside voting booths; and geometry texts are digestible when the reader can imagine putting on running shoes and sprinting around the circumference of a circle.     As much as you can, evoke sounds, sights, tastes, touches, and smells. Punch and pinch the reader; fill his nostrils with urine or the scent of cherry pie; rub him all over with wet paper towels; tune his inner radio to cool jazz or static; sprinkle cinnamon on his tongue… Sometimes you can evoke sensations by raw description: explaining what an object or scene looks like, smells like, etc. Sometimes you can animate a non-sensual abstraction via metaphor:    “She raged, accusing him of one thing after another. Each accusation was like a firecracker detonating in his sinus cavities.”    Humans have a sixth sense, which is just as evocative as the famous five—and I’m not talking about ESP. I’m talking about our kinetic sense, our sense of movement. Verbs that move are always strong: push, pull, kick, bend, straighten, leap, stretch, roll, amble, crouch, sprint… You can use them literally (“The penguin waddled”) or figuratively (“I toppled her argument”).  <br />
time for show and tell</p>

<hr />

<p>Writing teachers sometimes say “show don’t tell.” It’s not a bad heuristic for beginners, but it’s oversimplified. I prefer to say, “Earn the right to tell.” Telling—as in explaining rather than evoking—is harder for readers to relate to than the sorts of sensory data I outlined, above. So if you have something to tell, make sure that you’ve either prepped the reader by helping him picture (smell, etc.) the scene or by quickly following your telling with a sensory picture that illustrates it.     The show is the setup; the tell is the punchline.    The tell is the thesis; the show is the proof.    Example of showing and then telling:  <br />
	My girlfriend kept drinking all my beer. She would hog the remote control and force me to watch hours of ‘Sex in the City.’ She packed my suits into boxes and filled my closets with her dresses, jackets, and sweaters. She insisted on smoking inside, and my apartment still reeks of nicotine. She was a selfish bitch, and that’s why I broke up with her.
  The last sentence is telling, but I earned the right to tell from my earlier sentences that showed.     Example of telling and then showing:  <br />
	Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.    Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house. The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him…
  This famous opening, from Tolstoy’s “Anna Karenina,” starts by telling and then, to anchor the idea into the reader’s brain, switches to showing.    You don’t always need to formulaically tell first and then show or show first and then tell. What you need to do is just keep in mind that we sense easier than we understand ideas—and that we understand mostly through sensing. So by all means tell. Just make sure your telling is linked to sensations.    Also, keep in mind that “showing” means evoking. If you’re wondering whether “It was raining” is showing or telling, ask yourself whether or not itevokes the sensation of rain. I don’t think it does, do you? Try something like “the rain soaked through his shirt, plastering it to his chest….”     And keep in mind this excellent advice from novelist Chuck Palahniuk: <br />
	In six seconds, you’ll hate me.
	  But in six months, you’ll be a better writer. <br />
	From this point forward – at least for the next half year – you may not use “thought” verbs. These include: Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires, and a hundred others you love to use. <br />
	The list should also include: Loves and Hates.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>... Until some time around Christmas, you can’t write: Kenny wondered if Monica didn’t like him going out at night…”
 
Instead, you’ll have to Un-pack that to something like: “The mornings after Kenny had stayed out, beyond the last bus, until he’d had to bum a ride or pay for a cab and got home to find Monica faking sleep, faking because she never slept that quiet, those mornings, she’d only put her own cup of coffee in the microwave. Never his.”   
Instead of characters knowing anything, you must now present the details that allow the reader to know them. Instead of a character wanting something, you must now describe the thing so that the reader wants it.
  Instead of saying: “Adam knew Gwen liked him.”
  You’ll have to say: “Between classes, Gwen was always leaned on his locker when he’d go to open it. She’d roll her eyes and shove off with one foot, leaving a black-heel mark on the painted metal, but she also left the smell of her perfume. The combination lock would still be warm from her ass. And the next break, Gwen would be leaned there, again.”
  In short, no more short-cuts. Only specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling.   — http://litreactor.com/essays/chu...

<p>write sensually and you can forget most other rules</p>

<p>If you commit to evoking sights, sounds, smells, tastes, movements, and textures in the reader’s brain, you can quit sweating the small stuff. For instance, you’ve probably heard that strong verbs and specific nouns are better than adverbs and adjectives.     This isn’t necessarily true, but it often turns out to be the case—not because modifiers are bad, but because it’s easier to evoke sensations via concrete, easy-to-grasp objects and actions.    If you write, “he looked at her quizzically,” that’s harder to instantly picture than, “he cocked his head” or “he furrowed his brow.”    Don’t worry about adjectives and adverbs. Just work to evoke images and other sensations. Make your images strong and specific. </p>

<p>Should I avoid using idioms in my writing?</p>

<p>You can’t. In fact, you used two of them in your question: “avoid” means to step out of the way of a physical obstacle. Yet you used it to mean “refrain from a behavior.” You also referred to idioms being in writing, as if prose was a container. You used both “avoid” and “in” metaphorically, and those particular metaphors are idioms of the English language. Idioms are so bound up with the way we write and think, they’re unavoidable. Without using them, you’d be incapable of expressing many ideas.
The real trick to writing is make it sensual. Always aim to make readers see, touch, taste, feel or hear something*. We’re sensual creatures, and we have a hard time grasping concepts we can’t sense. This is just as important in non-fiction writing as it is in fiction. If you’re writing about geometry, make readers imagine peddling around the circumference of a circle or taking a shortcut across its diameter.
If you write sensually, you can forget about many other rules, because they’re all groping towards sensuality, anyway. For instance, “show don’t tell” is just another way insisting that you tickle the reader’s senses. Don’t just tell him it’s raining. That doesn’t make him feelwet. Evoke, for him, the nasty feeling of soaking, stiff jeans and waterlogged sneakers.
This goal, sensuality, is also why people advise against cliches. Due to overuse, they have lost their power to evoke. When you tell me every cloud has a silver lining, I don’t see clouds, silver, or linings. It just becomes a single word in my brain: everycloudhasasilverlining.
Idioms are fine, as long as they evoke sensations or don’t hamper something else from evoking sensations.

<p>I recommend The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person’s Guide to Writing in the 21st Century by Stephen Pinker; Politics and the English Language by George Orwell, and Spunk &amp; Bite: A Writer’s Guide to Bold by Arthur Plotnik. Read the last one last, as it’s about how to intelligently break the “rules,” and it’s worth knowing what they are first.</p>

<p>When I write, I imagine I’m a chef. My goal is to serve the reader a meal of words, sentences, and paragraphs—some sweet, some salty, some sour, and some bitter. If the reader only understands that a particular sentence is bitter, I’ve failed. I only succeed if he actually puckers up his mouth and winces.</p>

<p>There are no rules, except to do everything in your power to cause the reader to experience: make him feel something or force an idea to pop into his head—and make him hear the pop.</p>

<p>Nothing is forbidden, unless it blunts the experience. If breaking a “rule” strengthens the experience, you should break it. I might start an an essay about my cats this way:</p>

<p>“Fur. Everywhere.”</p>

<p>Mrs Sparks, my third-grade English teacher would tut-tut until she sounded like she was worshiping a dead Egyptian, but I think “Fur. Everywhere” creates an experience.</p>

<p>Let me give you some more examples: say you’re writing about the terrible conditions in a New Jersey prison. “The toilets are filthy” gets an idea across, but it doesn’t force the reader to lick the toilet water.</p>

<p>And if he doesn’t do that, he’ll probably forget my article five minutes after he’s done reading it. Humans don’t retain ideas; they recall sensual experiences. (Which means we need to take extra care to make non-fiction ideas sensual. When writing about Trigonometry, take your reader for a stroll around the circumference of a circle.)</p>

<p>(When drafting this post, I originally broke the last two paragraphs differently: “… but it doesn’t force the reader to lick the toilet water. And if he doesn’t do that, he’ll…” But then I realized that the “licking” part would be stronger if I let it breathe. So, I added a paragraph break after it. Always, always, I’m trying to strengthen the flavors for the reader.)</p>

<p>How about this? “No matter how many times you flush the toilet, the water is always brown.” I tried to use a verb the user could imagine himself doing: flush. And I did my best to evoke an image: brown water.</p>

<p>Every “rule” ties in with this goal of bombarding the reader with an experience. Why worry about grammar and spelling? Because this is distracting: “He bang his fase against the desk.”</p>

<p>That’s a strong image, but, as I read the sentence, I momentarily wonder why the writer used “bang” instead of “banged,” and why he misspelled “face.” Those thoughts, even if they’re gone in a heartbeat, dull the effect. The bang is less painful than it could be, worthy of one Tylenol at most and probably a children’s Tylenol at that.</p>

<p>Why “avoid adjectives and adverbs,” as some rule-based books advise? Because they’re (often) hard to visualize, and what we’re not visualizing, we’re not seeing. Compare “He walked carefully and quietly” with “He tiptoed.” Which is easier to see?</p>

<p>Why avoid the passive voice? Because it’s harder to visualize “mistakes were made by me” than “I made a mistake.”</p>

<p>I’m not suggesting you toss modifiers out the window and banish the passive to Siberia. My point is that, rather than worrying about rules, you should have a goal in mind: what do you want your reader to experience? Use words and grammar to make him experience it! Remove obstacles that hinder that experience!</p>

<p>How can I avoid clichés in my writing?</p>

<p>Good writing is sensual. I don’t mean sexy (though good writing can be sexy), I mean that it tickles the five senses. Sensual writing is the best way to reach people, because humans are sensual creatures. Humans live through their senses. When marks on paper evoke sensations, the effect is magical. Clichés suck, because they don’t make us see, hear, smell, touch, or taste. They fail because they’re too familiar. When people read “every cloud has a silver lining,” they probably don’t imagine a cloud or see the color silver. They don’t imagine running their fingers up and down a lining. Instead, it’s as if the whole phrase is a word: everycloudhasasilverlining. It’s a label for an abstract idea. What’s the abstract idea? That bad things have good sides to them. (“Bad things have good sides to them,” while not interesting, is better than “Every cloud has a silver lining.”) If you want to evoke that idea with a metaphor, what are some images you could use? Images that aren’t trodden flat? Try brainstorming: “Every case of strep throat is an excuse to eat ice cream.” “Too bad mama died, but that black suit I’m wearing to her funeral sure is slimming.” Rather than avoiding clichés, which is a negative act (and thus hard to achieve), try working to make your writing as sensual as possible. As a side effect, clichés will wither and die. When I write, I go through each sentence (often each phrase) and consciously ask if I’m evoking an image: am I making the reader see a dead fly? hear the tink tink tink of a xylophone? Smell urine? Taste soup that’s so hot, it burns his tongue? Run his fingers up and down some corduroy pants?
The trick is specificity. Don’t worry about being original, just be specific. What, exactly, are we supposed to see, hear, smell, touch or taste?</p>

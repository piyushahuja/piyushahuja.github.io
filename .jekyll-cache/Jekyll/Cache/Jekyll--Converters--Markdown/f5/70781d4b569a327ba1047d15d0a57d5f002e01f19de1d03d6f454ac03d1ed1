<hr />

<p>Rafael Nadal announced his retirement this month, and I want to take this moment to reflect on what makes him special.</p>

<hr />

<p>The problem with being Elon Musk is that he has no more green grass to chase, so imagines that grass on Mars.</p>

<p>The good thing about chasing the grass is greener on the other side is that it makes you chase, travel on roads to cities with skyscrapers, rather than be self satisfied in your little village tending to cows.</p>

<p>The wisdom is that not that the grass is not greener on the other side, that is is just as green on your side, but that grass can be grown where is ground for it to grow and willingness on your part, and that is more fulfilling than any grass consuming you can do, and the task of man.</p>

I"^<p>I’m now going to suggest some rules to you, which are good general rules of thumb, but which you shouldn’t follow like a lemming. You can – and probably should – break all of these rules if you have a reason to do so. But following them will give you a good writing workout and will generally help you write effective, muscular prose.</p>

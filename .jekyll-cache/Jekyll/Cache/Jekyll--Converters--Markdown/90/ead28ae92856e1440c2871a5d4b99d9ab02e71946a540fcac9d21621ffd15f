I"<p>They love me…they love me not.</p>

<p>By now I have a pretty good handle on the question. I don’t have to pick the petals of a poor flower: my body could tell.</p>

<p>“<em>You sort of know…don’t you”</em> said my friend Dawne. That you just <em>know</em> whether you’d hit it off with someone - pre-communication, pre-familiarity, pre- any dating rituals - was an idea that wafted through my skeptical mind - completely bypassed it - and struck a chord in the same area where the knowingness resided. It was true and I just knew it.</p>

<p>This is my attempt to reflect on the times I’ve felt loved, or acutely felt the absence of it, and everything in between. And especially when the instinct, or the reading of it, has led me astray.</p>

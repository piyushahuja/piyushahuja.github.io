<p><strong>Interests</strong></p>

<p>I am passionate about learning, teaching, and philosophy.</p>

<p>I used to be a competitive quizzer. I had my 15 minutes on fame when I appeared on some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5pdjrdj0uA">nationally televised quiz shows</a> in my college days.</p>

<p>I spend most of my free time learning. During my time in Cambridge, I’ve learnt shooting (clay pigeons), fencing, indoor climbing, tennis, squash, tango, 5 rhythms, contact improvisation, improv theatre, drawing, and cooking.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve studied the effectiveness of different learning strategies: through classroom to youtube videos, learning-by-doing and spaced repetition, and group learning. I’ve found: (1) learning is most effective when it is casual, voluntary and social. (2) Teaching someone something is a great way to learn yourself.</p>

</ul>

<p>Within philosophy, I am interested in questions of authenticity and the metaphysics of the self, such as: how does our vital life force work, and what causes it to diminish or flourish? I am interested in integrating academic philosophy as well as embodied philosophical practices such as movement, meditation, and breathwork</p>

<!--  With Sarah Maughan, I run a conscious dating workshop in Cambridge.  -->

<!-- I am driven by the philosophy of authenticity and questions in the metaphysics of self, soul, and consciousness that have a deep sense of mystery and magic: we say "be yourself", but how can we possibly fail to be ourselves? How do we get in our own way? How does our vital life force work, and what causes it to diminish or flourish?  -->

<!-- 
 One of the best way to learn is to teach it to someone. Platonia allows one to organize one-on-one meetups with people for learning-and-teaching. Give it a try! Here's the [download link for iOS]((http://itunes.com/apps/platonia)) and here's the [download link for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.platonia_client). -->

<!-- - **Teaching:**  I am interested in teaching or mentoring opportunies in philosophy, algorithms, and creative writing.

- **Learning:** I am looking for people interested in practicing Improv, First Aid, or Wilderness survival skills.  

- **Creative Collaborations:** If you'd like to collaborate on something for *fun*, please don't hesitate to reach out. Here are some ideas: a podcast, a comedy sketch, a mobile app, or any long-form writing assignment.

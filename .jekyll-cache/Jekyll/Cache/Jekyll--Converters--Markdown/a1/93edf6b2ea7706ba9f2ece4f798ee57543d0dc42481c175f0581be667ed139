‚ÄúIs it simply that people often feel depressed and hopelessly lost, and in poetry they see how beautiful and strange everything is (when you cut things however the poem does). So in that way poetry calms peoples anxiety.‚Äù</p>

<p>There are many different poems and many different kinds of poems. They are not all calming. Some poems make me anxious, angry, scared, and sad, which is why I value them. As a reader, I want a full meal, not just dessert. I want the sweet and the bitter. Often, I read poetry when I‚Äôm already relaxed. In fact, I read more in general when I‚Äôm not stressed out.</p>

<p>Here are the main reasons I respond to poetry, as far as I can tell:</p>

<p>Metrical poems (and some that are non-metrical) are about setting up rules and then bending them. Usually, this is done by setting up a rhythm and then violating it or almost violating it. And then returning to it again. This satisfies my craving for order and also my craving for testing boundaries.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs the same thing improvised jazz does. The pianist will start with the melody of ‚ÄúTwinkle, Twinkle, Little Star‚Äù and then veer away from it. If he veers too far, the performance will become noise; if he sticks too close to the melody, it won‚Äôt be jazz. The tension between order and chaos is luscious.</p>

<p>Poetry plays with language and often slams words together in surprising ways, which is thrilling the way food can be when the chef has paired ingredients you never thought would taste good together but somehow do.</p>

<p>Many poems are dense. Words mean two or three things at once and lots of suggestion is packed between the lines. This is intellectually stimulating and it allows me to read the same poem over and over, always finding new things in it.</p>

<p>And, of course, there‚Äôs the subject matter. It interests me just as it would i if the same subject was explored in a story or essay. Not all poems interest me in this way, but then not all stories and essays do, either.</p>

I"Ñ<p>They love meâ€¦they love me not.</p>

<p>By now I have a pretty good handle on the question. I donâ€™t have to pick the petals of a poor flower: my body could tell.</p>

<p>â€œ<em>You sort of knowâ€¦donâ€™t youâ€</em> said my friend Dawne. That you just <em>know</em> whether youâ€™d hit it off with someone - pre-communication, pre-familiarity, pre- any dating rituals - was an idea that wafted through my skeptical mind - completely bypassed it - and struck a chord in the same area where the knowingness resided. It was true and I just knew it.</p>

<p>But have there been times when I sort of â€œjust knewâ€ that I am not loved, but eventually I was? When my gut instinct has been wrong?</p>

<p>This is my attempt to reflect on the times Iâ€™ve felt loved, or acutely felt the absence of it, and everything in between.</p>

<p>B at Florence House</p>

<p>The first signal was in the m/w reunion. I was looking at her, but she wasnâ€™t looking for me. And I was suddenly overcome by feeling of grief, with memories of all those times when I imagine being loved but the reality swerves differently. â€œShe doesnâ€™t love meâ€. â€œIâ€™ll never be lovedâ€</p>

<p>Eventually, I sorted myself out and mustered the strength to meet her. When we hugged, she said, â€œyouâ€™re my favourite Indian man hereâ€ (I was the only Indian).</p>

<p>She spent the closing with Simon.</p>

<p>At the parting, she mentioned she was going to meet â€œsomeone specialâ€.</p>

<p>I was her second pick.</p>

<p>Seven months after that, we became lovers.</p>

<p>How was my body wrong?</p>

<p>I was overcome by grief. My mind said â€œI will never be lovedâ€. â€œThis is just like every other time.â€ â€œMy body knowsâ€</p>

<p>But the truth is: she did like me. Its just that I wasnâ€™t her desire at that time: I was her safety. But months later, eventually, we did become lovers.</p>

<p>What did I do right? I accepted her truth. I never tried to get. I didnâ€™t come on too strongly. I kept in touch. I kept my heart open. But she was good to me, too - that made it easier.</p>

<p>S at Compton Dundon</p>

<p>She spent the closing with Simon.</p>

<p>But the next morning, she sat next to me.</p>

<p>She wasnâ€™t nervous talking to me, â€œwe have to say goodbye donâ€™t weâ€.</p>

<p>Towards the end, she offered me a lift.</p>

<p>I sent her a love letter.</p>

<p>She responded immediately, but demured.</p>

<p>A few months after that, we spoke on phone. She wasnâ€™t shy or nervous or anxious - I was. She was funny and confident.</p>

<p>A few months after that, I dropped her a voice note, offering to visit. She had a week to think about it - and then she invited me.</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t think she would - I was wrong - but she did.</p>

<p>We spoke on the way. She spoke lovingly and sent me flirtatious messages. This is what being loved looks like, feels like. I was welcome.</p>

<p>And we became lovers.</p>

<p>How was my body wrong?</p>

<p>At the closing I was overcome by grief. Thoughts of never being loved â€œI will be forever aloneâ€ rocked my system.</p>

<p>But thatâ€™s an overreaction. She did like me. At the time, she was just looking out for herself: what was right for her. It was a matter of time.</p>

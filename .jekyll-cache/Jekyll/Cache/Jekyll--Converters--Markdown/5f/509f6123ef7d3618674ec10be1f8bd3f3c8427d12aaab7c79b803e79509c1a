I"f<p>There is a “way of be” in the world that is tantric.</p>

<p>It is non-reactive and relaxed.
It feels free, in the “flow of life”, genuine, authentic, “in integrity”.
All emotions are welcome, including: fear, anger, sadness (to investigate: what about “stress”, “anxiety”, “nervousness”, “jealousy”). 
It has heightened awareness of emotions. 
You see reality “as is”, including the emotions of others. 
You have needs, but you are not “needy”. You are not in a “getting” state. 
You give freeily, but do not “give to get”.
You are able to play and take risks.</p>

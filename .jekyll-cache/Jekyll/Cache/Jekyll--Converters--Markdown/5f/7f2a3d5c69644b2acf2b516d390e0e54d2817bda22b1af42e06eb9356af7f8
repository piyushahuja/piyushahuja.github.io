<p><strong>(1) The Problem of Adverse Selection: How do you attract the right crowd? The very concept attracts sketchy people.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If your product is purely, explicitly about dating  - without any other utility , you’d fail to attract the right crowd. People who are highly valued in the dating market have little trouble finding dates in the real world, and to attract them you need to provide an additional hook (like the appeal of learning something new)</p>
  </blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having a profile almost spells like red-flag. Perhaps I’m prejudiced about this, but if you haven’t got anyone interested in you in your day-to-day activities and you interact with at least a decent amount of people (I can forgive my friends in Antarctica). Then something might not be alright with you or the people around you. I get that some people might have a hard time dealing with social situations or get a little anxious from interpersonal interaction, yet that won’t go away when coming back to real life. Sooner or later you’ll need a handful of fresh air to deal with it. In Tinder and other sites everything is implying a 1-to-n relation. I’m not saying casual is bad, it’s just that when you meet somebody and they are basically gouging the market for “fun and profit” an honest connection with them is the least you can expect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The thing about dating services is that they work a lot better when they’re not explicitly marketed as dating services. Facebook started out as a thinly veiled dating service, where the primary activities were looking up people you might want to date and communicating with them. But the product was marketed as a more general tool, even keeping the meaning of the “Poke” button rather cryptic. Instagram is in the same vein - a large use case is showing your friends and acquaintances how cool and attractive you are, with the goal of raising one’s dating status. And Instagram is marketed towards making sunsets and pictures of flowers look better, allowing users to realize for themselves that a Gaussian blur might make their selfies look better too. Huge numbers of products are marketed towards increasing one’s attractiveness in some way, whether shampoo or automobiles or clothing, and outside of Axe body spray, very few of them are explicit about it. There’s no reason that websites wouldn’t follow the same script.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those that go searching for love only make manifest their own lovelessness, and the loveless never find love, only the loving find love, and they never have to seek for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But how do you find out if that cute, smart, and young lawyer you stumbled upon on an app is actually what he claims to be and not some creepy wife-beater looking for some action on the side? <em>Non-monogamy is invisible.</em> OkCupid has settings for non-monogamy and open relationships. I use them. Despite that I am frequently matched with people who are explicitly against what I want. And of the non-monogamous people I have dated, about half of them refuse to put their preferences online. It’s supposed to be a built-in feature. But it’s not used that way. I dislike the time and tact it takes to filter through all of these people.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Few people are as nasty in person as they can be online - but some are. I hate to give them the satisfaction of my response, but it’s demoralizing to be called names to your face.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a dark underbelly to online dating that attracts spammers, con artists and those not suited for modern love. A recent lawsuit filed against Match levelled the claim that more than half of its profiles were inactive or fake, an accusation the company denies. Real-life users can be problematic, too. Stories of dates gone awry abound, ranging from the merely awkward to the truly creepy to the tragically abusive. A California woman sued Match after a sex offender she met on the site allegedly raped her. Match has since begun screening new members against the national sex offender registry.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So my biggest qualm with online dating sites is that although you meet people you normally wouldn’t meet, you also meet people that you shouldn’t. There is no third party to vouch for their character. One of my good gentlemen friends met a professional woman online who seemed ideal. Fortunately, he’s smart: he hired a P.I. and found out that the woman had extorted a house out of another man, and the two were involved in a court battle. Another friend met a local guy who tried to get her to loan him money for a new business. Shameless. So although they aren’t Nigerian scammers, they’re scammers lite. In real life, they are avoidable. In real life, you’d typically meet someone through your social circle (friends, neighborhood, church, school). Because there is connectivity within your circle, you know who has a stellar reputation or a dodgy one. If you don’t know, you can always find out by asking around. You sure as heck already know if someone is married with kids (or if they’ve scammed money out of someone).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ysabelle Cheung, a 26-year-old writer in NYC who has tried Hinge, Happn (a location-based app), OkCupid, and CMB, says,  “Have I been hurt? No. Have I been offended? Many times. I’ve been sent messages with bulging packages and penis heads, and, strangely, on one of them, I receive a lot of messages from men into BDSM. The messages that disturb me the most are the ones from guys asking if I want to violate them or hurt them—and they always say I look like I’d be into it!” women get bombarded by the online equivalent of dudes who shout “Nice tits, giz a smile” on the street?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“if you want to find the largest cluster of deluded liars, check out online dating sites. Many of these people could be done for violations of the trade description act if it applied to dating. For quite a lot of guys, it seems that making contact with a woman online means that it’s time to get their penis out, photograph it and send it to her.”  You get a load of winks and there is always one guy that takes umbridge about the fact that you didn’t wink back or get in touch with him</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having previously encountered convicted felons on Tinder, 27-year-old marketing manager Katherine Carter, in Los Angeles, is now solely on Bumble. “Tinder feels more like a hook-up site—and the amount of unflattering guy selfies is pretty absurd. They ask for your cell phone number and then send you dick pics, and now this creep has your number,”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh, honey. Because the very last thing many people consider when they join online dating sites is their own suitability. (Insert smiley-winky emoticon here.) Human beings are a rather vexing species: we have one big blind spot when it comes to (you guessed it!) ourselves. Some of us don’t sit down and make a list of the things that we have to bring to the table—things of intrinsic worth, like trustworthiness, reliability, and decent problem-solving skill. Similarly, we often don’t see our BIG GIANT DEALBREAKERS. “There’s a lid for every pot.” Well, that old chestnut might be true, but it’s going to be very difficult to find that lid if you hoard pets, get sloppy drunk every other night, or have a bad propensity to ratchet up a ton of discretionary debt. We view our weaknesses as strengths and our strengths as weaknesses. So you have a lot of people who join online dating sites who assume they’re all that, and they’re clearly not all that and they’re not about to change one damned thing about themselves. And, irony or ironies, they of countless deficits have a long list of must-haves in a prospective partner. Very few of these must-havesanything to do with compatibility. A lot of people look for someone to fit into their lives when they have no desire to fit into anyone else’s—not in any practical, substantive way. Which, by default, makes them unsuitable to date. Again, it’s that blind spot. But to be fair, there are some really kind and decent people who use online dating the proper way. (I approached online dating with the mindset of compromise and equal ground, not finding someone to do my every bidding.) So it would be a disservice to paint all users with the same brush. Just because there’s far more of one than the other doesn’t make the whole enterprise a bust.”</p>

<p><strong>Possible Solutions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Forced Exclusion</strong> by users, by women, or by money: Only allowing women to invite, or Invite only (The League), Only paid members (Aisle)
    <ul>
      <li>We’ve all grown accustomed to free dating products, it’s a tall order asking people to pay when they can find the same people on other free apps. Charging everyone only works if you’re creating a gated community around a niche (like Raya)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Selection By high-effort UX</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>E-harmony: the ridiculously long personality quiz presents a high barrier to entry that filters out casual browsers and cheaters, and it provides enough info about long term plans to avoid early pitfalls of meeting someone you like only to find out you aren’t compatible in fundamental but not first-date discussion ways (do you want kids, your thoughts on religion, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Ratings or Reviews</strong> from Parents (Muzmatch), from friends (TrulyMadly), from other users (Lulu, The Grade).
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Female users answer multiple-choice questions about a man’s sense of humor, manners, ambition, commitment level, and look and style. Results are converted to a 0-to-10 rating, which constitutes a guy’s “score”. Unlike other review-based systems, they cannot add their own comments.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The question is whether he can make the idea of rating other human beings as palatable in a dating app as it is in an app like Uber. When Peeple, the “Yelp for humans,” was announced recently, there was <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/peeple-app-is-a-terrible-idea-2015-10">an outpouring of anger from the media and the general public</a> . Lerner thinks part of that is because of the idea of rating anyone, even people who don’t use the app. With Peeple or Lulu, you can blindside someone with a horrible review even though they never consented to the app in the first place. It feels invasive.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A feature where users can rate whether someone they have met via the app resembles their photo or not.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>First, the ratings won’t allow any freeform text. When confronted with someone’s profile you’ll be able to answer one question about them: “Is this a ‘quality’ person?” That’s it. The thinking is that combing through a dating app to leave one bad “yes/no” user review on your ex doesn’t seem particularly fun, even for the most vindictive among us. The Grade then takes the sum of all these “yes/no” answers and gives your profile a grade.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Beyond the “grading,” you’ll also be able to pick from a list of pre-determined hashtags to describe someone, in a move that is similar to the girls-rate-boys app Lulu . This too is meant to control the trolls. If you are downloading The Grade, you know what you are getting yourself into, and you are choosing it because you want some accountability. And the way it is set up, the only risk you’d be subjecting yourself to is a few negative ratings in a general sense. The Grade lacks the specificity that can be the most stinging part of anonymous online gossip, which is essentially what apps like Lulu are. Lerner thinks that reviews, in some form, are the logical next step of dating apps. Someone has to deal with the fact that dating apps often devolve into an intensely hostile place for women, he says. He just doesn’t know yet whether The Grade will be the app to crack the code.</p>

<p><strong>(2) How do weed out fake profiles?</strong></p>

<p>This is different from sketchy profiles, in that sketchy profiles are real people with undesirable behavior, but fake profiles are fake (in the sense of a spam sellers, bots, scams, catfishing etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Possible Solutions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Moderators (Coffee Meets Bagel, Dil Mil)</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>To weed out fakes on her app, Kang of Coffee Meets Bagel implements monitors who keep watch. CMB curates matches, and only first names are revealed when a match is made with your “bagel” (sent daily at noon; you have 24 hours to bite or not).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Reporting misuse by users</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Verification (Social Media, Manual)</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Tricks such as a real-time selfie requirement which time stamps photos, to try to avoid people posting out of date pictures for their profile. (The real-time selfie requirement is slightly undermined by the app auto-applying a filter to your selfie which can result in a slightly less than au natural shot but a smattering of ‘mood lighting’ is obviously intended.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Dil Mil claims to perform multi-source verification based on external data sources to weed out fake profiles.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Trust Score with Verification from social media  (Truly Madly)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Phone calls (Aisle, Floh)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To find love on TrulyMadly, you will have to submit copies of identity cards like passport, driving license, or PAN</p>
        <ul>
          <li>(Permanent Account Number) card. The TrulyMadly team will verify the ID proofs, social media profiles, and employment records to make sure that you are who you claim to be. If you make the cut, you will get a trust score based on how much real data you have submitted. Then the app will do the matchmaking. That will be based on the psychological profile it drew from likes and dislikes you confessed as well as what is evident from your social network persona.
            <ul>
              <li>With women accounting for a quarter or less of people using dating apps, there’s a way to go. As part of the effort to make them feel safer, most apps subject men to a more stringent verification process including a double-check of marital status and assign them a higher ‘trust score’ if they provide a LinkedIn account and upload a government ID. Higher the trust score, more matches you will get. So girls and guys have an incentive to submit better and more ID proofs to raise their trust scores.</li>
              <li>Tinder <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/tinder-introduces-verified-accounts-notable-people-so-you-know-theyre-real-1997734">boasts</a> “verified accounts” for celebrities only.</li>
              <li>Bumble The app will soon grant checkmarks (well, bumblebees) to users who maintain a quick response time and message ratio, complete their profiles and have never been reported for inappropriate behavior.</li>
              <li>e Grade – an app that exposes how fast and often people respond to messages and the quality of these texts. The Grade scans users’ app use and assigns a letter-grade for all to see.</li>
            </ul>

<p><strong>(3) How do you ensure people are incentivized to share their true selves while respecting their needs for privacy and assurance that their personal data isn’t misused?</strong></p>

<p>Anonymity in dating apps is a double-edged sword – many users (women in particular) prefer to know that their date is a real person and want a background check, and the easiest way to do so is by connecting user profiles with social networking profiles. At the same time people do not want their personal details disclosed. The best way out is to enable your dating app to provide partial anonymity where users see each other’s faces and names, but other personal details like place of work and study are not disclosed.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“People tend to like their dates less on average once they’ve met them face to face,” he says. “They tend to like the online version better.” An online profile, of course, is not an accurate reflection of someone, but a template for them to project their ideal self-image. “Once you meet them in person, it’s harder to have as many optimistic illusions about them,” says Fiore. “We engage in this kind of idealisation when we’re faced with limited information about people online. We fill in the gaps optimistically.” Fiore calls this “an illusion of specificity”. “It’s a way to give someone a sense of control,” he says.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The LIESSSS!!! All of these are real lies that were told to me through online dating that I found out were patently untrue upon our first or second meeting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“I love to work out in my spare time” Has never worked out. I don’t even care!! Why lie??!?</li>
    <li>“This picture is full of friends I see all the time” Hasn’t seen any of the people in at least 5 years and doesn’t have any current friends to speak of.</li>
    <li>“This picture was taken in the last three months and yes I weigh this much.” Showed up 20 years older, 30lbs heavier and considerably balder than his picture.</li>
    <li>“I don’t have kids”. Did, in fact, have two children with two different women.</li>
    <li>“I’m not married” “I’m just not divorced yet”</li>
    <li>“I have teeth” Okay, he didn’t say that but all of his pictures showed teeth and he showed up with a brand new truck and a missing front tooth that had been missing for two years. We obviously just had different priorities.</li>
    <li>I left out the guy who began sobbing in the middle of a small restaurant before our drinks even arrived because of how much he missed his wife and two daughters. Turned out he had only been separated for 8 weeks after 12+ years of marriage.
I’m not saying they couldn’t be lies told through regular dating but they are easier to tell online.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like Kara, Kayla worries apps don’t provide enough information. “While using dating apps, chemistry can be good texting, but by the second date you often find you would absolutely never have gone out with this person in a natural setting. This might happen with friends too, but would probably be less dramatic to get out of,” Kayla said.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Online dating fatigue Peters described: They invested time and emotions upfront, only to be disappointed to see their digital dream in the flesh.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dating profile, like the Facebook or Myspace profile, is a vehicle for projecting a curated and stylized version of oneself into the world. In a way, the online persona, with its lists of favorite bands and books, its roster of essential values and tourist destinations, represents a cheaper and more direct way of signalling one’s worth and taste than the kinds of affect that people have relied on for centuries—headgear, jewelry, perfume, tattoos. Demonstrating the ability, and the inclination, to write well is a rough equivalent to showing up in a black Mercedes. And yet a sentiment I heard again and again, from women who instinctively prized nothing so much as a well-written profile, was that, as rare as it may be, “good writing is only a sign of good writing.” Graceful prose does not a gentleman make.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fact that you can’t get away with lying in your profile for long doesn’t prevent a lot of people from doing it. They post old photographs of themselves, or photos of other people, or click on “athletic” rather than “could lose a few pounds,” or identify themselves as single when they are anything but. Sometimes the man says he’s straight but the profile reads gay. Sometimes he neglects to mention that he is a convicted felon. OK Cupid, in an analysis of its own data, has confirmed what I heard anecdotally: that men exaggerate their income (by twenty per cent) and their height (by two inches), perhaps intuiting that women pay closer attention to these data points than to any others. But women lie about these things, too. A date is an exercise in adjustment.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>People create a persona online that may not hold up in person. If you’re looking for someone to do a particular activity where chemistry is not the most important factor or requires limited dialogue, like rock climbing, an app or website might be useful.</p>

    <p><strong>Real-time selfie requirement</strong> which time stamps photos, to try to avoid people posting out of date pictures for their profile.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Users’ personal attributes are simply buttons you pick from during sign-up, and written in <strong>less stuffy language like “mom boss,” “fitness fiend,” “fashion killa,”</strong> for example. You can also go into your profile to add or remove these descriptions, if you choose.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TikiTalk also has <strong>a “board” to post updates</strong> like you would on Facebook (or using Tinder “moments”), and others can follow you, though Ahn was careful not to show how many followers people have on their profiles: “This makes it equal playing ground for everyone and also discreet. I feel like with Instagram and other apps, it just becomes a popularity contest. How many followers do you have, how many likes can you get. And that’s wack.”</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>(4) How do you ensure that people are not objectivified? How to design with good taste and sensibilities?</strong></p>

<p>*It felt like I was judging friends based on looks, as opposed to personalities, and I felt a little self-conscious they were doing the same”</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>And even Fiore acknowledges that for all the utility online dating provides, reducing potential soulmates to pixelated thumbnails and fields of information can be a draining experience. “It can feel a lot like shopping for a blender on Amazon.com,” he says. “But these are people we’re talking about, not blenders.” Not even the most potent computers in the world, it seems, can engineer a panacea for lonely hearts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve tried various dating apps and websites throughout the years. Result: I haven’t even made a friend from any of them. Every experience with one of these apps I had was kind of depressing and humiliating. (I also have a very small potential dating pool anyway, so that certainly doesn’t help.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>i think part of the problem is the bad taste anyone would have in their mouth after using any of the obviously fake dating sites that have existed to date. as the majority of dating sites are littered with vast amounts of fake or ancient profiles, after a person has been through a few, they usually write them all off as fake or poor quality. its just an industry, much like adult, that collectively has not done itself many favors in the eyes of the general public and past customers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“The demeaning sexual atmosphere that places a relentless emphasis on good looks (Tinder being the most prevalent example) in such a superficially nightmarish way it makes the way my generation hooked-up seem positively chaste and innocent by comparison” - <a href="http://www.vanityfair.fr/culture/livre/articles/generation-wuss-by-bret-easton-ellis/15837">Generation Wuss by Bret Easton Ellis</a></p>

    <p>If you look like Thor from the Avengers, you’ll find yourself flooded with matches and messages from dozens of women. If you’re less than 5′10, scrawny, and have bad facial hair, you might find yourself struggling to get proper footing online.</p>

  <li>
    <p><em>It feels like a commoditized meat-market.</em> Would people feel the same on Tinder if there were no pictures on profiles?
      * —Oh my gosh, I’ll swipe this guy. Look how much he loves nineteenth century Russian Literature. Здравствуйте handsome.
      * —You say? Tolstoi was like so hot.
      * If I wanted to go to a meat-market I would very much prefer going out to a club and at least get checked out honestly with no strings attached. Rejection might be common in such a situation, but at least it’s fast and down-to-earth. No girls I know need more than five minutes to smell whether they like you or not.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.theleague.com/">The League</a>, they declared that they were “totally and utterly ashamed that this dating service came out of Stanford,” “Is it possible to get any more elitist than this? Does it even cross your mind that you are endorsing the idea that wealth, class and privilege determine a person’s character?”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Removing photos (Lex), blurring photos, moving photos to the bottom of the profile. Generally making it hard to see how someone looks. The rationale behind this is well-meaning.
    <ul>
      <li>when it comes to dating, physical attraction is important.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Orienting the product around video. Video calls, video dates, videos in profiles.
    <ul>
      <li>Video is high effort. We know we’d learn much more about a person with video, but we prefer to use dating apps in bed, no makeup, in an oversized Google tee. No one wants to video date in this state</li>

<p><strong>(5) How do you judge compatability and give the right recommendations?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many market-watchers have questioned the basic premise of eHarmony and other sites, which depend on long detailed profiles and dedicated algorithms. Economist <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dir.20106/abstract">Dan Ariely and other researchers have argued</a> that online dating profiles rest on a <strong>fatal flaw: They show “searchable” attributes, like job or religion, while ignoring the key details of a dater’s personality: sense of humor, conversation style</strong>, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’ve <a href="http://www.thehappytalent.com/blog/-i-dont-want-to-be-with-a-man-who-loves-my-intelligence">previously written</a> about how incredibly lucky I have been in love . I’ve dated some of the most amazing men, most of whom continue to make me proud and take my breath away. But, honestly, <em>I don’t think I would have dated a single one of them if we’d met online</em>. Because, all else equal (i.e., we haven’t met yet), I would want to date a super intelligent, super compassionate, 6’5 or taller athlete who loved the outdoors, theater, and eating burritos and Chinese food four or more times per week. Who is also really good at music. It wouldn’t hurt if he were also good-looking. *This describes none of the people I’ve date”. <strong>Dating sites are designed too rationally. But love is irratinal, spontaneous.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

  <p>It’s wrong and also ineffective, because the truth is, <strong>most of us are pretty terrible at knowing what, or who, we actually want.</strong> You might think that having a dating site for, oh, Democrats would be a good idea if you’re the kind of person who can’t fathom a Carville-Matalin match. But here’s the thing: When OkCupid scrubbed the data, it found that political affiliation didn’t tip the scales on compatibility. People didn’t really care if you were a Republican or a Communist. What mattered most was simply how passionate each person was about politics in general: Diehards go with diehards, lukewarms with lukewarms.</p>

  <p>“This problem takes a subtler form when the mismatch is less obvious. While I try to be open-minded regarding many things, there are certain realities in my life which are difficult to change. My job requires traveling and I enjoy traveling tremedously. So, when I receive a message from a woman whose profile is filled with talk of buying a house and settling down near the family, that is a very likely irreconcilable problem. Even if I wanted to do something like that, it isn’t financially feasible for me to do so. But, online dating tends to allow people to see what they want to see. “Travel a lot for work” becomes “travelling is a hobby that I would immediately give up for the right person”. It does not matter how clear you are. Even if I wrote “Travelling is an integral part of my financial well-being and it cannot be avoided or abandoned without immediate and severe repercussions to my long term security and stability”, I would still get messages from future housewives wanting to settle down and marry, because the platform allows viewers to easily disregard problems and overemphasize minor commonalities.”</p>

My point is that <strong>taste is situational and varies from month to month</strong> - ESPECIALLY with younger people who haven’t created a blueprint for the exact partner they expect to marry within 72 hours of their profile going live. Rather than condescendingly telling you what you want, an algorithmic matching system should provide knobs and levers which empower youto discover what works and what doesn’t.</p>

<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Algorithms Based On Revealed Preferences</strong> Match began “weighting” variables differently, according to how users behaved. For example, if conservative users were actually looking at profiles of liberals, the algorithm would learn from that and recommend more liberal users to them. Indeed, says Thombre, “the politics one is quite interesting. Conservatives are far more open to reaching out to someone with a different point of view than a liberal is.” That is, when it comes to looking for love, conservatives are more open-minded than liberals.  The more sophisticated algorithms attempt to identify and exploit the dissonance between what you say you want and what you really appear to want, through the choices you make online. “What you do is more important than what you say,” Greg Blatt, who is the C.E.O. of I.A.C., and a former C.E.O. of Match.com, told me. (Blatt not only runs the company; he’s also a client. He is one of those guys who say they enjoy dating. You may specify that you’d like your date to be blond or tall or Jewish or a non-smoking Democrat, but you may have a habit of reaching out to pot-smoking South Asian Republicans. This is called “revealed preference,” and it is the essential element in Match’s algorithmic process.  Codenamed “Synapse”, the Match algorithm uses a variety of factors to suggest possible mates. While taking into account a user’s stated ­preferences, such as desired age range, hair colour and body type, it also learns from their actions on the site. So, if a woman says she doesn’t want to date anyone older than 26, but often looks at ­profiles of thirty-somethings, Match will know she is in fact open to meeting older men. Synapse also uses “triangulation”. That is, the algorithm looks at the behaviour of similar users and factors in that ­information, too.
creating relevant connections by having a huge enough <strong>ACTIVE user base continually generating information such as answering questions, attempting connections, swiping on photos, reviewing profiles</strong> etc. If you can create positive connections at the start that overcomes a pair’s standard qualification bar on both sides, that would be pretty amazing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Survey-based matching algorithms</strong> (OKCupid’s Complex algorithm based on values) where users provide infor-mation about themselves. Such algorithms suggest matches based on shared interests, hobbies and life-goals, and can be quite effective if they are concise and user-friendly. Curating suggestions based on user preferences results in fewer choices, but focuses on quality rather than quantity. Psychology tells us that people do not like to be overwhelmed by the number of available choices, so showing only a few matches that have been carefully selected for every user is a good idea!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Facial recognition-based matching algorithms</strong> are based on the assumption that we subconsciously choose people with the same type of faces. No dating app currently uses face recognition technologies (officially, at least), but enthusiasts have recently created a <a href="http://crockpotveggies.com/2015/02/09/automating-tinder-with-eigenfaces.html">bot for the Tinder app</a> that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenface">Eigenfaces</a> for building facial models based on user likes and dislikes and then follows these patterns to search for matches automatically.</p>

<p><strong>(6) How to avoid the tragedy of common’s with female attention?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a fundamental imbalance in the social dynamic,” Harj Taggar, the investor at Y Combinator, told me. “The most valuable asset is attractive females. As soon as you get them, you get loads of creepy guys.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s another layer: how to sort the matches. “You’ve got to make sure certain people don’t get all the attention,” Rudder said. “In a bar, it’s self-correcting. You see ten guys standing around one woman, maybe you don’t walk over and try to introduce yourself. Online, people have no idea how ‘surrounded’ a person is. And that creates a shitty situation. Dudes don’t get messages back. Some women get overwhelmed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a major Catch-22 to online dating from a male perspective. In order to receive a response, you must A) flood the platform with a huge number of messages B) Write messages of sufficient quality to attract a profile view.
 The result is a system where you are obligated to invest huge amounts of time with a resulting pay-off of overwhelming, crushing rejection.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I started, I would send out 20–25 small paragraph long, unique messages per night. Of those, I’d probably receive one response every four to five days.
That is a base response rate of around 1 in 100. That’s not dates. That’s just replies. I don’t blame women. They are often flooded with messages to the point that it is impossible to respond to all of them. Still, that is a lot of rejection. If you kept that up for a month, that would average about 396 rejections. Systematized and laid out in neat spread sheet form on the sent messages panel.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m a reasonably athletic 33-year old photographer who spends large portions of his life on an airplane. When I receive a message from a 55-year old, 380 pound single mother of three living on disability, how am I suppose to respond?
Truth be told, I probably ignore the message. In an ideal world, I’d craft the perfect chivalrous response which left her feeling wonderful about herself.
In reality, I receive several of these incredible mismatches a day and responding in any way is usually a no-win proposition. Yet, if I don’t respond, then I become the very source of rejection that I complained about first. Which leaves me in the Inescapable Jerk Paradox.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine that 19 men and women have paired up splitting the gains $50:$50 but leaving one woman with neither a spouse nor any gain. Being rational this unmatched woman is unlikely to accede to being left with nothing and will instead muscle in on an existing pairing offering the man say a $60:$40 split. The man being rational will accept but this still leaves one women unpaired and she will now counter-offer $70:$30. And so it goes inexorably drives down each woman’s share of the $100 to one penny — except for the 20th woman, who gets nothing at all. Simply stated, in non co-operative markets with shared resources, small changes can trigger massive changes to individual incentives, leading to a mutually bad equilibrium state. In the case of dating apps, the shared resource in question is a female user’s attention. American dating apps roughly have a ratio of 60% male to 40% female. With Indian apps, this ratio may be even more skewed. When you take activity into consideration, men have been found to be twice as active as women, which makes the ratio even more lopsided.  already seen how even slight imbalances in a market can dramatically shift the power away from the overrepresented group. This skewed ratio would translate into men trying that extra bit hard to get female attention on dating services and when extra hard in the Tinder generation means just another right swipe, this imbalance leads to men swiping right on as many female profiles as they possibly can. <strong>The problem is simply that signalling interest in a female on most dating apps is too “cheap” — it costs nothing monetarily</strong> (which is why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9431383/tinder-super-like-available-now">Superlike</a> is brilliant), and requires little time or emotional investment.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m going to talk about the heterosexual dynamic only because that’s what I know. Women have a larger selection of men to choose from but are harassed so often that online dating is daunting. Men don’t get approached nearly as much as women do, and this alone can potentially be discouraging. It’s a confusing system. It seems like men feel like they need to work hard and express interest to lots of women knowing how much rejection they’ll face. Women tend to be pickier, but to be fair the options are limited because of how many guys are inappropriate in their messages. Overall, it seems pretty exhausting no matter which side you’re on, and I’ve seen plenty of friends give up on online dating. It makes me really glad I’ve happened to meet guys in real life who I’ve gone on to date.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the fake male profiles only matched with other users 0.6 percent of the time, around ten percent of female profiles were liked, mostly by men. The researchers postulate that women are more picky on Tinder, only liking the profiles of men they’re attracted to, whereas men play a brutal numbers game by liking everyone in sight. make matters worse, men are less likely to send messages: only seven percent of men who matched with a fake profile sent a message, compared with 21 percent of women. This creates a horribly counterproductive feedback loop, wherein women become more picky because everyone they like seems to like them back—and men, faced with increasingly selective women, drop their standards even further.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a smartphone will swipe right on basically everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have an attractive lady friend who has Tinder, and she showed me the amount of traffic her account received. All she had to do was swipe right several times, and she had matches with <em>every single guy</em>. What does this mean for regular Joe’s who don’t look like Captain America? Well, our messages get swept under the rug and 9/10 we aren’t getting women who are attractive (to each its own).</p>

<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You have to pay to <strong>filter low-quality content</strong>. Now this isn’t a surprise - the site has to make money somehow. You’re either a free user, or a paying user. One of the paying-user-features is the ability to filter messages by length. More than %50 of my messages are three words or less. The exact words rotate between hi, there, hello, fuck, gorgeous, Asian, ur, wassup, and me. The single biggest complaint of female users is how they are bombarded by low-quality messages. Getting three is funny. Getting three hundred is exhausting. The single biggest complaint of male users is that there are relatively fewer women, and that they are more reluctant to message and respond. Partly this is social conditioning. But I bet women (at least this one) would spend more time online if they could filter out these kinds of messages. Making this a free feature would improve most users’ experiences.</p>
  </li>

      <li>Girls can see the guys on a map, but <strong>guys can’t see the girls at all unless they are approached via a ‘tap’</strong>. This means that girls have to make the first move. “It’s the only app to have a truly asymmetric experience,” Kingsley-Miller says. “ For starters, rather than the usual click-happy, shopping-cart experience provided by the likes of Tinder, with Antidate what you’re downloading is effectively a one-way looking glass. Meanwhile, the patient male participants won’t have to tap 8,000 profiles (7,999 of which are spambots or half-marathon bores or the true originals who threaten “If you can’t handle me at my worst, you don’t deserve me at my best…”) before getting an unenthusiastic nod in their general direction.[http://jmarbach.com/so-what-do-you-do-at-your-startup]

  At first I liked this app. However, after a while I realized it’s really geared to benefit men.

  <p>“Take an interest in whatever it is she likes. You don’t have to pretend to love it. In fact, don’t pretend to like what you don’t like. But if a girl says “Oh, I’m really into anime!” reply “Yeah? Tell me about that!” Ask questions about whatever it is she likes, and for the love of all that is holy, listen. Respond. And the sexiest part of all? REMEMBER. It’s absolutely awesome when you mention something to someone and they go “Oh yeah! You were telling me about that. Is that the one with XYZ?” I try to do this in the relationships I’ve had and not only do I learn a ton about random topics, I found that the other person was way more excited to talk to me because they could tell I was engaged and that I cared.” - <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-things-that-girls-wish-guys-knew-when-it-comes-to-dating">What are some things girls wish guys knew about dating?</a></p>

<p><strong>(9) How to minimize flaking?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It actually shocks me how often my friends tell me that they’re excited about a date, only to inform me (when I ask how it went) that the dude “rescheduled. Granted, flaking is just part of the culture in SF (whether you like it or not), but when you take two strangers—one or both—with a predilection for canceling plans, instead, rely upon the instant gratification of apps… or, alternatively, just don’t care about dating at all</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I was looking for friends through an app because my co-workers are a little older than me, have children and live outside the city. My current friend group has different priorities than I do. They want to stay out super late, take shots and take each other home like they’re still in college. I’ve also had a problem with flakiness. I want friends who are loyal, serious about their commitments, and trustworthy, but still know how to have fun,” “My experience was a little awkward. It’s hard to strike up a text conversation with someone you’ve never met in person, especially in a friend context. I chatted with a few people but everything eventually fizzled out,” Katelyn explained.</p>

  <p>Jean Kim, 27, a product manager at a New York City– based digital media company who is on Tinder and has tried Bumble, finds apps like Tinder “really hit or miss,” she says. “I have over 200 matches right now but no real ongoing conversations. Sometimes I’ll get excited about one person, but it’s almost like these guys just want somebody to text all the time rather than actually meet up with. At a certain point, I give up. I’m getting carpal tunnel.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Time based opt-in (Tonight Feature, Free For)</strong>, a feature that allows users to essentially order a date on-demand. users can opt-in for a date tonight, put in a specific time, and HowAboutWe will search through your potential matches for people comwho’ve also opted in for a date tonight. In about five minutes, according to the company, HAW will <em>send a push notification asking users to look at their potential dates and double-tap on the ones that they’d like to go out with</em>. Once all interested parties have made their selections, HAW matches them up with the best fit based on various factors and sends both users into a text conversation. All messages go through a HAW number so that users’ phone numbers aren’t automatically shared. The core function behind Lovestruck is the ‘free for’ feature. It lets you change your profile on a daily basis to let potential matches know whether you’re “Free for Lunch” or “Free Tonight” and it really promotes spontaneous dates.</p>

    <p><strong>Activity-based opt-in (How About We)</strong>  A friend of mine who has been helping me refine the pitch, as well as think through the product, created a group called “Date Ideas in SF”. I thought it was a good potential use case for VoteChat, but didn’t think that it would lead to much. I posted a comment about how my favorite date was a motorcycle ride to the twin peaks of San Francisco for an amazing view. I didn’t check my phone for a few hours. A few hours later, when I check my phone, I see that my cofounder Felipe had left the idea “Homeless Shelter”. * You can also create a group chat in the app, where you’re able to suggest an activity and poll the others for a preferred time. When the poll wraps, you can tap to turn the poll into an invite and another tap adds it to your calendar.</p>

    <p><strong>Paid dating</strong> According to Poppenreiter, Ohlala seeks to improve upon two perceived flaws that Tinder and other dating apps often fall into. First, the in-app chats that go nowhere — or worse, promising matches who ghost on you. As more results-oriented users of Tinder or OkCupid can attest, if you’ve logged on with the objective to meet up with someone that night, you can often be left frustrated. With Ohlala, everyone wants something, and everyone’s on a tight schedule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Deadline from message to date</strong> Each open date request only lasts 21 minutes; once a couple starts chatting they have one hour to decide whether or not to go on a date.</p>

<p><strong>(10) How do you destigmatise the product so that it can be social in the same way that Skype or Facebook might be?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the stigma is quickly passing, it’s not like consumers want to sign up for a dating site and then invite their friends+family to join them on the site. In that way, it’s more similar to a financial or health product, where some privacy is required.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think that has more to do with how publicly one has to use/consume the product. E.g. most people don’t like to tell their friends that they have a sexual toy at home, or that they like to binge eat, or watch porn or do something else that is considered shameful once exposed publicly. However as long as it’s not a social product (e.g. porn sites or the axe deo), it’s fine, since they do it privately. The problem with online dating is that it exposes one’s intentions more publicly. The embarrassment factor is somewhat declining though - according to Pew Internet’s online dating survey it was 21% in the US in 2013 vs. 29% in 2005.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The challenge still is to get more girls to come on to the platform. To get a 50:50 man-woman ratio on a dating app is quite an uphill task. Besides the safety fears, girls also see a slight taboo around dating. They don’t want to tell on Facebook or other social media that they are using a dating app,” Bhatia says</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>inviting their friends+family to matchmake</strong> See a list of all single friends. Pick a friend. The experience looks exactly like Tinder. You can play for guys or girls as long as you are in a relationship.Swipe for days. If the other person’s friend also picked your friend, woohoo, match! Have to find creative way to send the intro or bring in your friends into the conversation. Maybe if you are single you can only have an inbox. You cannot play.</li>

<p><strong>(11) How do you solve the chicken-and-egg problem of attracting enough initial users?</strong></p>

<p>A site like Reddit is interesting when there are only 20 users. But no one wants to use a dating site with only 20 users—which of course becomes a self-perpetuating problem. So if you want to do a dating startup, don’t focus on the novel take on dating that you’re going to offer. That’s the easy half. Focus on novel ways to get around the chicken and egg problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Lack of Single-Player Mode.</em> What value does the very first user to sign up for your service get? If you haven’t answered this question, you’re going to have a really hard time overcoming the glaring network effect problem of this space. Not enough utility for early adopters to cross the network threshold</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fake Users</strong> “…….Because Bumble has a silly rule that women write first, Bumble employees actually write from the fake profiles to keep you interested, but only write once. They never write again. And every time you search, the first 10–20 women will ALWAYS be fake models, with well-written fake bios, and then they send you 1 fake message so you think you have a chance with the hottie…….”</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve talked to many people- both guys and girls- about their frustration with this app. It seems as if the app shows you a bunch of insanely attractive people, but there’s just one problem- they don’t actually exist, so you’ll never match with them.”</p>

<p><strong>(12) How to avoid built-in churn? Should you?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The way these companies make money is not directly correlated to the utility that users get from the product,” Harj Taggar, a partner at the Silicon Valley seed fund Y Combinator, told me. “What they really should be doing is making money if they match you with people you like.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>One of the ways that the new generation of mobile dating products solve this is that they are free plus focus more on casual dating. Both factors open up the market to a wider audience, reduce churn, and create opportunities for viral growth.</p>

<p>How does one begin?</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Loving your body</strong></p>

<p>The first thing you have to develop is an ease in your body and your own sense of fun.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Step into your power</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLzsaEwZ9tY&amp;list=PLdIS7dENF-nUnxy3p6k-fYKpwPUofnoU1&amp;index=16&amp;t=6s">you’ve come to be danced</a></p>

<p>You are not dancing to be liked, you are not objectifying your body, you are not shying away in the corner, you are not copying others.</p>

<p>Instead, you embody the full expression of your life force and let it move you.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Do any movement whatsoever to start</strong></p>

<p>Then Just Move. This is the “Do Nothing” of ecstatic movement. Ask “How does my body want to move right now?” and just do it. That’s the whole instruction.</p>

<p>For most people who have internalized the taboo against joyful movement (which is to say 99.999% of adults in most cultures), this is not enough instruction. Most adults find it impossible to do spontaneous dance without alcohol or drugs for instance.</p>

<p>But keep this instruction in mind for later after you’ve overcome the embarrassment and shame of moving your body enjoyably. There is something absolutely beautiful and simple in just trusting in your body’s wisdom and moving that way. Dance therapy practices like “Authentic Movement” are basically this sparse in their instruction.</p>

<p>One risk of this totally open-ended instruction is some people report not knowing when to stop, or even feeling like they “can’t” stop. There’s an easy fix for that: set a timer, and then stop when the timer goes off. You’re always in control, even if you are temporarily choosing to hand over control.</p>

<hr />

<p>Bounce</p>

<p>Since you can’t yet do full spontaneity, some creative constraints or structure can be useful. Here is a simple version I came up with, which can be scaled from as little as 3 minutes to as long as you’d like.</p>

<p>There are 3 phases to this practice: bouncing, shaking, and flowing.</p>

<p>First decide how long to practice. 10 minutes is good for a beginner.</p>

<p><strong>Bounce</strong></p>

<p>Begin standing, with feet a comfortable distance apart. Gently bounce up and down by bending your knees. Imagine dissolving or melting all the needless tension from your body and letting it sink into the Earth.</p>

<p>Importantly, also include your breath here, by taking big inhales and letting it out with a sigh, a long “Ahhhhh” sound, humming, or something else that feels like releasing tension.</p>

<p>You don’t need any music for this, just bounce gently and enjoyably.</p>

<p><strong>Shake</strong></p>

<p>After a few minutes, or when you feel you’ve bounced enough, shake out your body more vigorously. This can mean increasing the speed of the bouncing to be faster and more chaotic, or shaking out your arms and legs, or whatever else increases the speed and intensity, including the emotional intensity, really letting out the tension.</p>

<p>Don’t tense up too much. Notice where your body is tense and release the tension. This is an important point for avoiding some of the potential risks of this practice. Most of the potential negative side-effects come from tension and forcing. So emphasize shaking to release the tension, not to create more tension.</p>

<p>This phase can get emotional. Some people might experience anger or sadness, maybe even wanting to yell or cry. This is perhaps due to releasing trauma, exiting the “freeze” response. If it’s too intense, you can always go back to gentle bouncing, or stop and lie down. That said, intensity is part of what you are working with here too, so it’s a balance, where you’re learning to experience the intensity of being fully alive, and releasing needless rigidity, but also keeping helpful structure.</p>

<p>During the shaking phase, you can also make sounds, buzz your lips, sing or shout or just blow out air if you want to be quiet but involve your breath. Not everyone has a safe space where they can make weird sounds, so adjust as appropriate to your practice environment.</p>

<p><strong>Flow</strong></p>

<p>For the final phase of “flow,” start moving around the room as if you are doing tai chi, or swimming in the air, or doing your impression of a hippie at a Grateful Dead concert, moving your feet and arms in a fluid, flowing fashion. Fantastic!</p>

<p>For a beginner, 3 minutes of each phase is enough, then 1 minute of just standing in place feeling the body, or lie down and feel the body. You’ll notice a lot more energy and vitality in the body after this practice than before.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>5 Rhythms</strong> is a form this: Flow, Staccacto (e.g. Bouncing), Chaos (e.g. Shaking), Lyrical, Stillness</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Contact Improvisation</strong></p>

<p>Each person has a centre of gravity, but when two are in contact, there is one centre of gravity, you move like one four legged animal (hip to hip, or pelvis to pelvis)</p>

<p>A sense of shared balance.
listening, deep curiosity, meet each other in a new way that language does not provide.</p>

<p>Feel the ground through the other when off the ground. If you lose contact with the ground, you’re still listening to it. the feeling of becoming one animal connected at the core and flowing through that. connected, safe.</p>

<p><strong>Tango</strong></p>

<p>Shift Weight to indicate which leg you’re going to move forward.
Don’t be tentative - be decisive about your intentions, where to move, so the lady can follow.
Dance to melody, not beats</p>

<p>Conversation of intentions through body.</p>

<hr />
<p>walking, turning, basic cross, ochos.</p>

<p>Feel the weight - in hands, and frame: dont relax it. thats what directs the follower.</p>

<p>Body like a tank: upper frame rotates.</p>

<p>When you move forward, dont be worried about stepping on the toes of the follower, as they have their fit slid quite backward. Move it next to their feet on the other leg. Land on the heel of your toe.</p>

<p>Stopping: Also, the follower is following your frame, not your legs. The frame only move forwards when you move forward, not when you bring back leg level.
Think of yourself as a pendulum that goes down when moving sideways or forward, up when just shifting weight at the same spot.</p>

<hr />

<p>Touch” (the embrace) as the main communication channel between you and your partner, and that can range from just a pair of arms to the full chest. Any slight pressure or slant off the vertical is perceived as an intention to move in that direction. one of the core training of Tango movement is to learn to discipline the body to not emit unintended signal,</p>

<p>musicality, body mechanics, spacing, navigation</p>

<p>Focus on walking (not moves) and close embrace.</p>

<hr />
<p>Musicality: learn the basic beat format of a tango, milonga and waltz. Be able to pick up the right down beat and be able to walk on the beat with each step. 17 minutes.</p>

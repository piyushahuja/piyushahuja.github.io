I"	<p>There is a “way of be” in the world that is tantric.</p>

<p>It is non-reactive and relaxed.
It feels effortless, free, in the “flow of life”, genuine, authentic, “in integrity”.
All emotions are welcome, including: fear, anger, sadness (to investigate: what about “stress”, “anxiety”, “nervousness”, “jealousy”). 
It has heightened awareness of your own emotions, your senses. 
You see reality “as is”, including the emotions of others. 
You have needs, but you are not “needy”. You are not in a “getting” state. 
You give freeily, but do not “give to get”.
You are able to play and take risks.</p>

<p>Often I criticize myself for not being socially savvy, for not being able to make small talk or have conversations with beautiful women. But the reason I feel uncomfortable to talk to certain woman have nothing to do with ability, but often about the cues that I have picked subconsciously picked up up on how the other person’s attitutde towards me.</p>

<p>Example: After the men-women reunion, I felt comfortable talking to Sarah, Kathy, Vanese, Stella, but not with Ingrid, Katie, etc. This was entirely due on them, and nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>It might be good to bring these cues to awareness, so that I communicate.</p>

<p>Erring on the side of asking for permission always works: “Would you be comfortable texting?” rather than assuming one way or the other. If i assume too much, I might signal i am not good at boundaries, or am intrusive. If I assume too less, I might miss out on connection where possibility of connection exists.</p>

<ul>
  <li>May I hold your hand?</li>
  <li>Would you be comfortable talking about sexual matters?</li>
  <li>Would you be open to texting?</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

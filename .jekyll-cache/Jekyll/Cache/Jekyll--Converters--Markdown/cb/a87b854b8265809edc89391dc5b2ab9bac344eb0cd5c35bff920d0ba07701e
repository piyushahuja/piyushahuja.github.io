I"B<p>What counts as a nation?  The deceptive simplicity of the question masks the underlying complexity of the considerations involved. Take the case of India. In the north, Kashmiri separatists have since long been demanding a separate nation based on Kashmiriyat.  The Khalistan movement in the 80s and 90s demanded a separate nation for Sikhs (based on religion).  Separatist movements in North-East  have previously demanded separate nations of Assam (for Assamese), Tripuri (for Tripuran Christians) and Nagalim (for Naga people). Meanwhile, in the last two decades, four regions (Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Telangana) have managed to carve out their own federal states  based on ethno-linguistic lines, asserting their difference from the rest of the nation without ever questioning their common national identity.  But defiant secessionist movements and compliant internal divisions are not the only puzzling aspect of Indian nationalism. Some even believe in  a unification with neighbouring states. Many organizations (including the current ruling party BJP) , have frequently called  for the the creation of Akhand Bharat (literally, Undivided India) - a unification of Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and parts of Afghanistan and Myanmar, based on the legendary ancient civilisation and heritage of SE Asia.   In a region with a rich history,   extraordinary mixture of ethnic groups, the profusion of mutually incomprehensible languages, the varieties of topography and climate, the diversity of religions and cultural practices, wide regional economic and political disparities, which claim for a nation is legitimate, and which is not? (The case of India is just illustrative. Parallels can be drawn with similar cases in Europe and Russia, for example)  Generalising this question, what, really, counts as a nation?</p>

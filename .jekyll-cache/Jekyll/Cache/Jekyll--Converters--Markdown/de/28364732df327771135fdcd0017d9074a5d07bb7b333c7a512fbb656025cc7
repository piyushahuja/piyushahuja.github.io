  <li>Most of DP problems can be divided into two types: optimization problems and combinatoric problems.
    <ul>
      <li>The optimization problems require you to choose some feasible solution so that the value of goal function is minimized (or maximized). You are often trying to either minimize or maximize a decision. You are given two (or more) options at any given point and you have to decide which is more optimal for the problem youâ€™re trying to solve. These decisions, however, are based on previous choices you made.
        <ul>
          <li>The optimal substructure vares n how many subproblems are used n an optimal solution to the original problem and  how many choices we have in detemining which subproblems to use.
            <blockquote>
              <p>Optimal Parenthisizaton: 2 subproblems used, n choices at most    <br />
Activity Selection Naive: 2 subproblems, n choices at most.    <br />
Acvitity Selection Greedy Observation: 1 subproblem, 1 choice  <br />
Assembly Line Scheduling: 1 subproblems used 2 choices</p>

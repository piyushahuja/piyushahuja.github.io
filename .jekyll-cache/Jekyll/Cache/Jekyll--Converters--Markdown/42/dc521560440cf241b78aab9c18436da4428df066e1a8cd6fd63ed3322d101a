I"i<p>34 this month, and time to take stock once again.</p>

<p>This juncture of life feels crucial in a way others weren’t. It feels as if I am at a risky bend in the road, and if I don’t maneuver it well, I could be forever derailed in many important areas of life: career, relationships, and family.  I am already late, but not too late, and this feels like a last chance: it might be too late after this bend.</p>

<p>As the inspription on my Oxford clocktower said, “It is later than I think, but it is never too late”</p>

<p>Facts of human condition, and the zeitgeist/society/market I am living in.</p>

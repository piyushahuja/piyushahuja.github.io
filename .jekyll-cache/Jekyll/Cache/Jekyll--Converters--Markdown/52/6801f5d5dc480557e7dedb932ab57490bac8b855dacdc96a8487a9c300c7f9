I"g<p>Pattern:</p>

<p>I want to connect with everyone. I want them to like me. If someone doesn’t like me, I want to do things to make them like me.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To do things to get someone to accept you, could easy turn into a manipulative territory: you’re taking on their responsbility for them</li>
</ul>

<p>To effectively pretend to be a certain way, you have to really believe it, or be aware of it. You need your mind to create an image or rule and then control you into fitting that. This impedes any access you might have to how you actually feel. So you live in a fake world, a world “above”, and have no connection with the below.</p>

<p>This is what the feedback “you need to let go” refers to. The mind’s attachment to an image. The control of feelings.</p>

<hr />

<p>Antidote: Embodied self-awareness.</p>

<p>How to be more embodied? movement, dance and deep breathing</p>

<p>self awareness: What are you noticing, within and outside?  thoughts, feelings, senses, energetic awareness of other people, of the room.</p>

<p>This is no easy practice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>stay attuned to my own inner (thoughts, feelings) experience</li>
  <li>stay attuned to your outer experience: listening to others on a feeling and energy level and responding , reading the room and the energy in the room, noticing details</li>
  <li>seek the touch of the beloved in every moment’s happening: make love to every moment</li>
</ul>

<p>Sutra:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>There is no image you can hold
No thought you can think 
That encompasses the Great Self

Your essence
is immortal and unchanging
Yet it is the foundations for all that moves

Rest in the shimmering emptiness
That is the source of the world
And remember who you are
</code></pre></div></div>

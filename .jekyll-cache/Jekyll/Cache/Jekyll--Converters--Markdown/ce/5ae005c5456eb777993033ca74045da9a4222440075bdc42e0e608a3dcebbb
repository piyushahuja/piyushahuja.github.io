<p>Whitman says â€œI am large, I contain multitudesâ€.</p>

<p>Jarod Lanier points out our tendency â€œreduce ourselvesâ€ in order to make our description of them appear more accurate, â€œinformation underrepresents realityâ€</p>

<p>And Nietzche has an answer:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>How can man know himself? It is a dark, mysterious business: if a hare has seven skins, a man may skin himself seventy times seven times without being able to say, â€œNow that is truly you; that is no longer your outside.â€ It is also an agonizing, hazardous undertaking thus to dig into oneself, to climb down toughly and directly into the tunnels of oneâ€™s being. How easy it is thereby to give oneself such injuries as no doctor can heal. Moreover, why should it even be necessary given that everything bears witness to our being â€” our friendships and animosities, our glances and handshakes, our memories and all that we forget, our books as well as our pens. For the most important inquiry, however, there is a method. Let the young soul survey its own life with a view of the following question: â€œWhat have you truly loved thus far? What has ever uplifted your soul, what has dominated and delighted it at the same time?â€ Assemble these revered objects in a row before you and perhaps they will reveal a law by their nature and their order: the fundamental law of your very self. Compare these objects, see how they complement, enlarge, outdo, transfigure one another; how they form a ladder on whose steps you have been climbing up to yourself so far; for your true self does not lie buried deep within you, but rather rises immeasurably high above you, or at least above what you commonly take to be your I.</p>

<p>AIMO Prize: The AIMO Prize is a $10mn challenge fund, founded and supported by XTX Markets, designed to spur the open development of AI models that can reason mathematically, leading to the creation of a publicly shared AI model capable of winning a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).</p>

<p>The first progress prize included problems at intermediate-level high school mathematics competitions, tricky math problems written in LaTeX format, high school students use to train for the International Math Olympiad. This competition includes 110 problems similar to an intermediate-level high school math challenge. The Gemma 7B benchmark for these problems is 3/50 on the public and private test sets</p>

<p>A unique dataset of 800k+ competitive level problems and solutions was a key success factor for winning and we are thrilled to release it to the public. We now look forward to seeing far better models built upon the Numina dataset.</p>

<p>The dataset encompasses a range of difficulty levels, from simple arithmetic to algebraic thinking and geometric reasoning.</p>

<p>Major challenge: The assessment of AI modelsâ€™ mathematical reasoning skills faces a significant hurdle, the issue of train-test leakage. Models trained on Internet-scale datasets may inadvertently encounter test questions during training, skewing the evaluation process.</p>

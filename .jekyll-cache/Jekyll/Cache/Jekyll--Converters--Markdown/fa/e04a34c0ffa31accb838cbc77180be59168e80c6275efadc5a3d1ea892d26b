I"/<p>They love me…they love me not.</p>

<p>I feel by now I have a pretty good handle on the question. I don’t have to pick the petals of a poor flower: my body could tell.</p>

<p>“<em>You sort of know…don’t you”</em> said my friend Dawne. The idea wafted through my skeptical mind - completely bypassed it - and struck a chord in the same area where the knowingness resided: it was true and I just knew it.</p>

<p>This is my attempt to reflect on the times I’ve been wrong, if I ever have been, and how to tell one from the other.</p>

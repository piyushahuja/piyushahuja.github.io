I"R%<p>34 this month. It’s time to take stock.</p>

<p>This juncture of life feels crucial in a way others weren’t. It feels as if I am at a crucial bend in the road, and if I don’t maneuver it well, I could be permanenly thrown off track, derailed, in many important areas of life: career, relationships, and family.  I am already late, but not too late, and this feels like a last chance to course correct.</p>

<p><strong>A Retrospective</strong></p>

<p>Years ago, at 25, I had created a wishlist of six goals for myself: to strengthen my body, to sharpen my wit, to become proficient in programming, to inculcate an ability to lead, to learn life saving skills, and to write a novel (the last of these was for retirement).</p>

<p>Looking back, it is quite revealing that the five of six of those centred around personal development. If I am really honest with myself, the primary drive that motivated those was to get rid of a fundamental feeling of discontent with my who I was - a persistent, lingering feeling that I was aware of yet found hard to dispel. These concerns (to be fit, competent, and demonstrate community leadership) can also be seen as anxious preoccupations of a young man growing into his masculinity.<sup id="fnref:assess" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:assess" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>At 30, my desires had morphed primarily to three: to build a company, to write a novel (post-retirement), and to have my own happy family.  At 32, I bought my first home (fetches £20k in annual rent now).  At 33, following a competitive £15k grant, I started a company. Over the course of the year, I developed an extensive network in India, UK, and US, recruited a friend and hired some interns, and attracted and fulfilled a £34k+ contract.  Over all this time, the romantic idea of writing a novel has lost its charm, and I can now see myself joining a company rather than building my own. The desire for a family remains.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>So, what are my immediate priorities at 34?</strong></p>

<p>First, I want to build a family with a life partner I love and respect, a family home that is big enough to host my parents, and where I’d bring up my children.</p>

<p>Second, I want a job that engages my best capabilities with smart coworkers I enjoy working with, that earns me enough money for quality childcare, education, and leisure, and affords me ample flexibility to be present for my family.</p>

<p>Third, I want to embody and sustain a spiritual, feel-good, healthy masculine energy. I want to feel that feeling of gratitude again, where I would feel extraordinarily lucky, good things and people start coming in my life, I become extraordinarily productive, and I find beauty in everything and experience the joy of living.</p>

<p><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></p>

<p><strong>The First Challenge: Wife and Children</strong></p>

<p>I am 34 now. I have at most five good years of being able to have children. <a href="https://joanobryan.com/2024/10/19/how-to-family-plan/">This is an eye opener</a>.</p>

<p><a href="(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x61KdbH4LaE&amp;list=PLdIS7dENF-nX1Vuo-eVnDlGoZ6UKdKY0G&amp;index=2)">This</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBndhR9GcWM">this</a> evokes the family life I want. This feels like the only realistic timeline that makes that possible</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be relationship with someone by 35 (in six months)</li>
  <li>Marry by 36</li>
  <li>Have my first child by 37</li>
  <li>Have my second child by 39</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>The Second Challenge: Career</strong></p>

<p>I have 10 years of prime employability where I can be flexible on location. A lot about the choice depends on my partner. Ideally, I want to maximise my earnings, network, and growth.</p>

<p>I could live in</p>
<ul>
  <li>US for money, network, growth, newness, and friends in Bay Area</li>
  <li>UK for work-life balance, PhD potential, existing community, and Richa</li>
  <li>India for labour leverage, parents, money, network, and good childcare</li>
  <li><del>Germany fo women, work-life-balance, and a new challenge (PhD?)</del></li>
</ul>

<p>This are the areas I could focus my energy on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leetcode + System Design to get a job in Big Tech (London/Bay Area)</li>
  <li>AI/ML Stack for a Mid tier company or early stage startup</li>
  <li>My own products: platonia, more projects, e.g. AI Moderator with Tue</li>
  <li><del>A new challenge or niche (Robotics or ML PhD)</del></li>
</ul>

<p>A remote friendly position could be ideal.</p>

<p>A plan could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move to US between 35 and 36</li>
  <li>Stay in US for one year till birth of first child (37)</li>
  <li>Alternate between London (Richa) and India (Mom) for bringing up child.</li>
  <li>Have a second child</li>
</ul>

<p>Or</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aim for a job in London (Googe/FB) or Mid Tier (Sense Street, Sanger))</li>
  <li>Stay and raise a family in London</li>
</ul>

<p>Or</p>
<ul>
  <li>Move to India (e.g. Head of ML at Verona)</li>
  <li>Stay and raise a family in India</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>The Third Challenge: Aging Parents</strong></p>

<p>Mom will turn 66 in two weeks. She’ll turn 70 in four years.</p>

<ul>
  <li>By 70, she would probably need support.</li>
  <li>By 75, I would want to move near her.</li>
</ul>

<p>So after ten years (by age 45), I would want to move to India to support Mom full time.</p>

<p>How would that work with kids?</p>

<p>That’s a challenge to solve for later, with my partner.</p>

<p>My kids would be aged 5-10  when Mom is aged 70-80. During that age, I’d like my kids to be in London, Bay Area, or Bangalore, wherever IIT batchmates are. But I’d like them next to Mom as well.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Long Term Vision</strong></p>

<p>What do I want life to look like at 75?</p>

<p>I want to have a life of dignity and status post 60, with people who love me around me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’d like to have an extended family with grandkids.</li>
  <li>I’d like to teach maths, philosophy, and computer science.</li>
  <li>I’d like to make content (write, audio, video)</li>
  <li>I’d like to to pursue spirituality as a guru</li>
  <li>I’d like to to have smart people around me.</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be good to accrue skills towards that.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For (1), I need to ensure the family plan is a success.</li>
  <li>For (2), I could partner with Harkirat on ML.</li>
  <li>For (3), I could partner with content producers like Bholu.</li>
  <li>For (4), I could continue to learn from Jan.</li>
  <li><del>For (5), I want to get a PhD. This will allow me to be more like Naveen Garg and Ambuj Sagar and less like Vivek Iyer or Robert Mules.</del></li>
</ul>

      <p>If I were to honestly assess myself on these ten years on, I did clear the bar on at least four of those. I became fit to the extent that people would compliment me on my fitness unprompted (or object to me calling myself overweight). The most beautiful girl in my meditation retreat referred to me as the funniest person in the group. As a product manager and, later an entrepreneur, I learnt to recruit and lead product teams, deliver products, and present talks at gatherings that were well-received.  The programming path took me to the level of senior software engineer.  As for the fifth: while I learnt first-aid, cooking fundamentals, and how to build a campfire, those skills still need practice and leave much room for improvement. <a href="#fnref:assess" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

I"ü<p>There is a â€œway of beâ€ in the world that is tantric.</p>

<p>It is non-reactive and relaxed.
It feels effortless, free, in the â€œflow of lifeâ€, genuine, authentic, â€œin integrityâ€.
All emotions are welcome, including: fear, anger, sadness (to investigate: what about â€œstressâ€, â€œanxietyâ€, â€œnervousnessâ€, â€œjealousyâ€). 
It has heightened awareness of your own emotions, your senses. 
You see reality â€œas isâ€, including the emotions of others. 
You have needs, but you are not â€œneedyâ€. You are not in a â€œgettingâ€ state. 
You give freeily, but do not â€œgive to getâ€.
You are able to play and take risks.</p>

<p>Often I criticize myself for not being socially savvy, for not being able to make small talk or have conversations with beautiful women. But the reason I feel uncomfortable to talk to certain woman have nothing to do with ability, but often about the cues that I have picked subconsciously picked up up on how the other personâ€™s attitutde towards me.</p>

<p>Example: After the men-women reunion, I felt comfortable talking to Sarah, Kathy, Vanese, Stella, but not with Ingrid, Katie, etc. This was entirely due on them, and nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>It might be good to bring these cues to awareness, so that I communicate.</p>

<p>Erring on the side of asking for permission always works: â€œWould you be comfortable texting?â€ rather than assuming one way or the other. If i assume too much, I might signal i am not good at boundaries, or am intrusive. If I assume too less, I might miss out on connection where possibility of connection exists.</p>

<ul>
  <li>May I hold your hand?</li>
  <li>Would you be comfortable talking about sexual matters?</li>
  <li>Would you be open to texting?</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p>Truth is, I was in a very different state of mind and feeling when I started this journey than I am now. It is impossible to recall how I my internal experience of myself used to be, but I remember the facts clearly:</p>

<p>I broke down in tears after Vaneseâ€™s initiation in LT1. Slowly at first, then violently when I realized that my beloved wouldnt not only look at me, but wouldnt even care for me. It felt pretty natural then, and was cathartic, but it was, in hindsight, what they call a â€œtrauma response.â€ It triggered all those memories of not being loved, not being cared for, and importantly, of â€œbeing abandonedâ€. I had thoughts of â€œThis, Again, Ofcourseâ€, â€œWould anyone ever love me?â€, â€œI have to live with this pattern foreverâ€.</p>

<p>I also got incredibly melancholic after the Men-Women reunion after LT1 in Florence House, after observing my beloved. Slowly at first, then back at the mattress. Mellower than the first, but this was also a â€œtrauma responseâ€ that reminded me of all previous instances of false hope.</p>

<p>I â€œgot backâ€ at Rich after my initiation in LT2. At the time, I felt in my power and proud of myself. And though difficult to see, this was also â€œa trauma responseâ€. Because the response was informed by fear of â€œbeing bulliedâ€. While authentic and in tune with how I was feeling, lacked a complete mindful awareness of the feeling.</p>

<p>Would I have the same reaction if the same series of events were to happen to me now?</p>

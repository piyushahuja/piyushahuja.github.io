I"ğ<p>How can someone who habitually writes in a turgid, didactic style change to using a more natural, conversational style?

My technique is to write an email. Not one Iâ€™ll ever send, but one Iâ€™ll actually write in gmail, rather than in a word processor, even if itâ€™s an essay or short story. (Gmail is great for this, because it saves drafts, so you can start and stop.) I pick an appropriate person to write to, usually a non-expert, and explain my idea, make my appeal, defend my claim, tell my funny story â€¦</p>

<p>The act of composing an email and writing it to a specific person forces my brain into a conversational mode.</p>

<p>Later, I cut the text into a word processor and redraft it, removing â€œDear Mom,â€ or whatever. Poor Mom never gets the letter.</p>

<p>I read everything I write aloud. Everything. If Iâ€™m worried about disturbing the people around me, I mouth the words. The act of vocalizing (or at least making mouth movements) helps just as much as the email technique. My brain becomes less writerly and more talky.</p>

<p>And I simply avoid hifalutin words. I donâ€™t completely shun them, if I insist on writing â€œambulate,â€ Iâ€™d better have a good reason. As I redraft, I hunt them down and shoot them in the head, replacing them with their homlier cousins. â€œTake that, â€˜vehicle!â€™ Blam! Iâ€™m replacing you with â€˜car.â€™â€</p>

<p>Being specific helps. Most stodgy writing is laced with abstractions. Just writing â€œchairâ€ instead of â€œarticle of furnitureâ€ goes a long way towards thawing frigid prose.</p>

<p>When in doubt, I ask a friend to read a draft. I tell him to underline anything obscure, forced, academic, or formal sounding. And I assume heâ€™s always right.</p>

<p>Do not affect a breezy manner.</p>

<p>The volume of writing is enormous, these days, and much of it has a sort of windiness about it, almost as though the author were in a state of euphoria. â€œSpontaneous me,â€ sang Whitman, and, in his innocence, let loose the hordes of uninspired scribblers who would one day confuse spontaneity with genius.</p>

<p>The breezy style is often the work of an egocentric, the person who imagines that everything that comes to mind is of general interest and that uninhibited prose creates high spirits and carries the day. Open any alumni magazine, turn to the class notes, and you are quite likely to encounter old Spontaneous Me at workâ€“an aging collegian who writes something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€˜Well, guys, here I am again dishing the dirt about your disorderly classmates, after passing a weekend in the Big Apple trying to catch the Columbia hoops tilt and then a cab-ride from hell through the West Side casbah. And speaking of news, howzabout tossing a few primo items this way?â€™</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an extreme example, but the same wind blows, at lesser velocities, across vast expanses of journalistic prose. The author in this case has managed in two sentences to commit most of the unpardonable sins: he obviously has nothing to say, he is showing off and directing the attention of the reader to himself, he is using slang with neither provocation nor ingenuity, he adopts a patronizing air by throwing in the word primo, he is humorless (though full of fun), dull, and empty. He has not done his work.</p>

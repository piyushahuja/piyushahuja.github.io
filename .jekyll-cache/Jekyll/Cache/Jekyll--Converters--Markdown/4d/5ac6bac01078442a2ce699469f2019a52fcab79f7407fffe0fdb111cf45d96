I"Ï<p><strong>Nietzsche‚Äôs Toward the Teaching of Style</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is from a letter that Nietzsche wrote to Lou Salom√© when she was beginning to write philosophy, and appears in her book on his work.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Of prime necessity is life: a style should live.</li>
  <li>Style should be suited to the specific person with whom you wish to communicate. (The law of mutual relation.)</li>
  <li>First, one must determine precisely ‚Äúwhat-and-what do I wish to say and present,‚Äù before you may write. Writing must be mimicry.</li>
  <li>Since the writer lacks many of the speaker‚Äôs means, he must in general have for his model a very expressive kind of presentation; of necessity, the written copy will appear much paler.</li>
  <li>The richness of life reveals itself through a richness of gestures. One must learn to feel everything‚Äìthe length and retarding of sentences, interpunctuation, the choice of words, the pausing, the sequence of arguments‚Äìlike gestures.</li>
  <li>Be careful with periods! Only those people who also have long duration of breath while speaking are entitled to periods. With most people, the period is a matter of affectation.</li>
  <li>Style ought to prove that one believes in an idea; not only thinks it but also feels it.</li>
  <li>The more abstract a truth one wishes to teach, the more one must first entice the senses.</li>
  <li>Strategy on the part of the good writer of prose consists of choosing his means for stepping close to poetry but never stepping into it.</li>
  <li>It is not good manners or clever to deprive one‚Äôs readers of the most obvious objections. It is very good manners and very clever to leave it to one‚Äôs readers alone to prononce the ultimate quintessence of our wisdom.

<p><strong>Paul Graham‚Äôs Advice</strong></p>

<p>As for how to write well, here‚Äôs the short version: Write a bad version 1 as fast as you can; rewrite it over and over; cut out everything unnecessary; write in a conversational tone; develop a nose for bad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours; imitate writers you like; if you can‚Äôt get started, tell someone what you plan to write about, then write down what you said; expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong; be confident enough to cut; have friends you trust read your stuff and tell you which bits are confusing or drag; don‚Äôt (always) make detailed outlines; mull ideas over for a few days before writing; carry a small notebook or scrap paper with you; start writing when you think of the first sentence; if a deadline forces you to start before that, just say the most important sentence first; write about stuff you like; don‚Äôt try to sound impressive; don‚Äôt hesitate to change the topic on the fly; use footnotes to contain digressions; use anaphora to knit sentences together; read your essays out loud to see (a) where you stumble over awkward phrases and (b) which bits are boring (the paragraphs you dread reading); try to tell the reader something new and useful; work in fairly big quanta of time; when you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far; when you finish, leave yourself something easy to start with; accumulate notes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file; don‚Äôt feel obliged to cover any of them; write for a reader who won‚Äôt read the essay as carefully as you do, just as pop songs are designed to sound ok on crappy car radios; if you say anything mistaken, fix it immediately; ask friends which sentence you‚Äôll regret most; go back and tone down harsh remarks; publish stuff online, because an audience makes you write more, and thus generate more ideas; print out drafts instead of just looking at them on the screen; use simple, germanic words; learn to distinguish surprises from digressions; learn to recognize the approach of an ending, and when one appears, grab it.</p>

<p><strong>Orwell</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.</li>
  <li>Never use a long word where a short one will do.</li>
  <li>If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.</li>
  <li>Never use the passive where you can use the active.</li>
  <li>Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.</li>
  <li>Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.</li>

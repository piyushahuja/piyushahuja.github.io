  </p>
  <!--<p class="excerpt"><p>What counts as a nation?  The deceptive simplicity of the question masks the underlying complexity of the considerations involved. Take the case of India. In the north, Kashmiri separatists have since long been demanding a separate nation based on Kashmiriyat.  The Khalistan movement in the 80s and 90s demanded a separate nation for Sikhs (based on religion).  Separatist movements in North-East  have previously demanded separate nations of Assam (for Assamese), Tripuri (for Tripuran Christians) and Nagalim (for Naga people). Meanwhile, in the last two decades, four regions (Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Telangana) have managed to carve out their own federal states  based on ethno-linguistic lines, asserting their difference from the rest of the nation without ever questioning their common national identity.  But defiant secessionist movements and compliant internal divisions are not the only puzzling aspect of Indian nationalism. Some even believe in  a unification with neighbouring states. Many organizations (including the current ruling party BJP) , have frequently called  for the the creation of Akhand Bharat (literally, Undivided India) - a unification of Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and parts of Afghanistan and Myanmar, based on the legendary ancient civilisation and heritage of SE Asia.   In a region with a rich history,   extraordinary mixture of ethnic groups, the profusion of mutually incomprehensible languages, the varieties of topography and climate, the diversity of religions and cultural practices, wide regional economic and political disparities, which claim for a nation is legitimate, and which is not? (The case of India is just illustrative. Parallels can be drawn with similar cases in Europe and Russia, for example)  Generalising this question, what, really, counts as a nation?</p>

  <a class="title" href="/liberalism">Is there a distinctive liberal conception of the good life?</a>
  <!-- <a class="comments" href="/liberalism#disqus_thread">View Comments</a> -->
  </p>
  <!--<p class="excerpt"><p>Human beings have various ideals that they value, that constitute what would be for them a good life, whose fulfilment they work towards. The idea of the good for each individual is informed by their circumstances, their unique talents and capacities,  their nature and their nurture. Very often ideas of the good are mutually incompatible. A vegetarian might regard consumption of meat as immoral and vile, a bodybuilder pursuing athletic excellence might value it instrumentally as a source of protein, while someone with a hedonistic bent may feel that such simple pleasures make life worth living in the first place. The appeal of liberalism, under such pluralism, lies in its apparent fairness to all ways of life.  I say apparent because a liberal society does seem to encourage certain values over others: the virtues of tolerance, the ideals of democracy, the spirit of secularism, individualism over collectivism, international cooperation, and so forth. This leads one to ask: Might liberalism be just another doctrine of the good life, masquerading as a neutral framework?  This is an important question, for if liberalism is merely one idea of the good life in competition with other such ideas, then it would lose much of its appeal and privileged status.</p>

  <a class="title" href="/public-interest">Is there such a thing as the public interest?</a>
  <!-- <a class="comments" href="/public-interest#disqus_thread">View Comments</a> -->
  </p>
  <!--<p class="excerpt"><p>The notion ‘public interest’ is frequently used as a justification of public policy, and advancing it is often seen as the central task of the political process.  What it refers to, however, is often vague, imprecise and unclear.  Considering the diversity in human nature, the sheer breadth of human needs and desires, wouldn’t any policy which claims to be ‘in public interest’ inevitably be against the interest of one group or another? (A road thats good for some people is a source of noise, pollution, and collision risk to others.) Consensus is a rare in almost any public policy issue, and conflicts of interest abound. What, then, is public interest?  Or is the term fraudulent, a misleading shorthand for the interest of the majority or the politically dominant group?  In this essay, I argue that it is possible to make sense of public interest, in all its various applications,  without assuming a perfectly homogenous population and without identifying the term with majoritarianism or regulatory capture.</p>

  <!-- <a class="comments" href="/free-will#disqus_thread">View Comments</a> -->
  </p>
  <!--<p class="excerpt"><p>Determinism is the philosophical position that our every future state is uniquely determined by prior states. For every event, including all human actions, there’s a set of existing conditions which would cause that event and nothing else. Indeterminism, on the other hand, holds that there are events which are not completely determined by prior events.  To get a flavour of the question, consider this:</p>

  <!--<p class="excerpt"><p>There are many different ways in which an ontological theory can be criticised. It can be called metaphysically extravagant, unintuitive, or unsupported and unsuggested by empirical findings, or, more damagingly - incoherent and inconsistent.    With regards to presentism, the greatest challenge comes from the empirical support for Special Theory of Relativity - a theory which, at least on the face of it,  seems to be ontologically committed to the denial of presentism. I will confess - I do not have a sufficient understanding of the special theory of relativity to see exactly how it renders presentism false.  Nor do I need to. For my present concern is the absurdity of presentism, not its truth or falsity. Specifically,  my charge here is that the theory of presentism is absurd regardless of the other criticisms it might possess. In light of its absurdity, one would need a stronger defence of presentism than what is required for other positions. If anything, the special theory of relativity doesn’t help its case. </p>

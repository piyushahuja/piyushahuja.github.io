I"1D<p>When you are out and about, <strong>watch people,  how they behave when they are on their own, how they relate in a group, how they get each other attention.</strong> Notice when it is that people actually have a conversation and when it is that they just take it in turn to brag. </p>

<p>Being in the moment A great improviser lives in the here and now, in the present. He is alert and is able to respond instantly and sharply to changes or sudden twists and turns. This means that all sorts of other thoughts do not distract him, but that he is totally focused on things that are happening around him at that particular moment in time. By being in the present, and not judging the situation, all options are open and everything is possible. </p>

<p><strong>Life <em>is</em> attention. Notice everything, particularly the details.</strong> Become a detective. Shift your attention from yourself to others.  Make an effort to remember names and faces. Keep on waking up.  This moment only happens once. Treasure it. Avoid multitasking. Attend to one thing at a time. Don’t prepare  Give up planning.   Attend carefully to what is happening right now. Allow yourself to be surprised.  Welcome whatever floats into your mind. Fear is a matter of misplaced attention. Focus on redirecting it.</p>

<p>Start with a concept, like seeing a disheveled-looking man ordering a coffee at Starbucks, and build up a story and a life around him. Create a history for him and plan a future. Ask yourself what his family is like, what he does for a living, what he does for fun, etc. If you notice something suitable for world-building, like two squirrels coming out of a tree, construct a fictional universe for them to live in. How are these squirrels related? What’s their language? Is the tree their house? Their place of work? Do they interact with other animals or are squirrels the only sentient animals in this world? Ask yourself world-building questions and then answer them.</p>

<p><strong>Play: Come up with random objects, list their uses. Then connect them</strong></p>

<p>Grab a pen, some paper and a timing device. In a few minutes time per subject, come up with as many uses as possible for the following objects (think of five random, unrelated nouns):</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Brick</li>
  <li>One shoe</li>
  <li>A Rope</li>
  <li>A Tape measure</li>
  <li>A Stereo Speaker</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s a quick example by Max Matterson:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pencil might give you: lead, words, sentence, write, sharpen, draw, pictures</li>
  <li>Judges could give you: sentence court, wig, life, oath, right</li>
  <li>What links these two things together? You might say wright(right) and sentence… Now put them together in a joke:</li>
  <li>
    <p>In what way are pencils and judges the same? They pass sentences, always have the last word and are wright all the time</p>
  </li>
  <li>Take any two concepts:
    <ul>
      <li>Eye Trouble: Lazy eyes, tearing, cross eyed, can’t see well, have trouble reading, need glasses, world looks funny or different.</li>
      <li>Dyslexia: Have trouble reading, letters and numbers look funny or different, can’t read well, can’t read quickly, have trouble concentrating.</li>
      <li>These are just a couple examples thrown together in a hurry to give you the idea. Obviously there are lots of other associations we might make from these, and yet we can already see that there are some pretty useful links between the two. So all we need to do is to make these links by applying a bit of lateral thinking and then presto. You have a quick joke like…
If you are cross eyed and dyslexic, does that mean that you can see perfectly?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Example: What’s the connection between a skeleton and a bar? 
A skeleton asks a barman for a pint of beer and a mop.</p>

<p>There is no connection between the two except that we recognize when the skeleton drinks there is nowhere for the liquid to go except the floor. What makes it funny is that the skeleton is unable to drink but wasting his money and good beer.</p>

<p>Play with someone:
With a friend, brainstorm a list of random objects. Write each one down on a piece of paper, fold them up, and put them in a bowl. Draw a piece of paper at random, and set a timer for 1 minute. Come up with as many uses for that object as you can before the timer goes off. Read them aloud, crossing out the uses that the other person also listed. Whoever has the longest list at the end of this process wins. </p>

<p><strong>Anthropomorphize everything and develop personalities for them.</strong> I find this is easiest to do with cars because their front grills are very expressive faces and their bodywork lends them a good personality. I think of BMWs as snooty french men (because of the moustache) and then the the different models of BMWs have different personalities. One thing that humans really have going for us is that we see humanity all around us. We are trained to spot faces wherever we look, like in the front grill of a car or an electrical socket. Where there is a face, there is a character.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Character relay: start a timer that beeps every 30 seconds and then, for that 30 seconds, begin a character monologue.</strong> There is no prompt. In fact, as much as you can, avoid preplanning any of the characters, or even thinking about the exercise. Jump right into the improvisation, and say whatever is on your mind. This is the point of the exercise.  After those 30 seconds have elapsed, instantly jump to a new character. Ideally, make it as different as possible from your previous character. Do the monologue for 30 seconds, repeat. This continues for as long as you like– I’ve only done it for about 20 minutes at a time, but Napier (the author) claims to have put people through the ringer for an entire hour at a time.
	- For example: Pretend to be a crotchety, 90 year old woman for 5 minutes. Practice her voice, stance, feelings, actions and reactions. 
	- Great! Now do the same for a toddler, a stuffy English butler, a hyperactive dog, a stoned west-coast surfer, etc. etc. etc. Create different characters by playing with the way you walk, talk, move, and improvise (out loud) monologues.</p>

<p>Set a clock for 10 minutes. Start with a character monologue. After no more than 60 seconds, you should slip into a two character scene with that character. From there, keep “cutting to” or wiping to related scenes, flashbacks, flashforwards, or completely new scenes. The two goals are a) to improvise nonstop for 10 minutes and b) to create as many characters and situations in 10 minutes as possible. Do one of these as a practice, and then do one for real. Let yourself be creative in your “cut-to” situations. This exercise strengthens an improvisor’s sense of responsibility onstage - you quickly learn that you can’t bail on a scene or check out mentally! It also builds your confidence, playfulness and your facility in being able to play and heighten a moment in a long form.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Do Solo Three Line Scenes</strong></p>

<p>These will feel strange at first, but it’s a great exercise to add to your warm-ups, as it gets your brain moving and gets you to commit fully to a range of characters.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In character, initiate a scene with an opening line.</li>
  <li>Then, changing your physicality and even your physical position, Immediately switch to a contrasting character - the larger the contrast, the better, and deliver the second line of the scene.</li>
  <li>Then, move back into the original position, physicality and attitude of the first character and deliver the third line of the scene.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the first few of these, start off being easy on yourself, then tighten up the scenes. Focus on getting out the who, what and where in those scant three lines. Work through negative and dismissive responses until you are only giving yourself positive agreements with each three-line scene. Push your range of characters and your range of contrasts - you should keep doing these until you are well beyond your stock characters.</p>

<p>Solo Two Character Scenes/three character scenes .
Once you have warmed up with three line scenes, slow down and try an extended two-character scene. 
Focus on giving gifts to yourself - “Rosemary, your pale gauntness is delicious!”</p>

<p>Let these go a little long so that you can explore the possibilities of being the sole driver of a scene. As you slip between characters, let yourself be physically neutral. Take care to keep the characters’ physicalities distinct. After a couple of these, challenge yourself to try three character and group scenes.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Play: Given random settings and objects, create a story</strong></p>

<p>Get 10 index cards.  Write one object on each of them.  Anything.  You can write “flowers” on one and “Belgian waffle” on another.  Now take a few moments to write five settings on a sheet of paper.  Examples can include: “ballroom dancing class,” “hostage negotiation,” “brewery tour.”</p>

<p>Shuffle your cards.  Pull two out and put them face up in front of you.  Create a  story involving these two items in the first setting that you listed.  It doesn’t have to be humorous at first, just plausible.  As you keep going, you can try to make it humorous.  Repeat until you complete the set.  Reshuffle.  Repeat.  Make it funnier each time.</p>

<p>Avoid Cartooning: Prioritie physicality (show winters by your behavior rather than tell its winter, if you are siblings get an energy (protective, nurturing vs competitive, sparring) into the relationship), Prioritize emotions (what do the rich details and idea make you feel? Excited or stressed? Happy or Sad?), Bring only one brick rather than the whole whole (one brick with one or two strong details. (instead of the folly of trying to control too much, for fear of unexpected directions or confusion)), give partners a chance to add to the scene (instead of generously getting the basic details out of the way, give a chance to the teammate to meaningfully contribute)</p>

<p>Confessions: (secrets) Own your confession fully to yourself (“I said something vulgar” vs “Your dad said something vulgar”), Give it time and space, feel the emotional weight (don’t explain away in lie of breath and feeling emotions, better when they change onstage relationships or throw light on pre-established facts or reuse shelved materials.Accusation: hiding, obscuring, or evading. creates tension or juxtaposition with known details, allow relionship/status to change, avoid counter accusation, rationalization and justification of the accusation (let the accusation land)Discover: Set it up. If someone has broken into the cabin, designate and embellish the features of a particular broken window. specificity breeds specificity. Make it important. discovery will typically start out as an environmental, costume or prop choice. most helpful and effective when it connects to or complicates the current relationships. discovery reveals about them or their motivations.  emerge organically from the previously established given circumstances. specific location:  it is significantly more difficult to discover an object or facet of the environment that can ramp up the dynamism of a scene if you are performing in a “nowhere” on an essentially empty stage. The more you craft an interesting location with a wide array of props and furniture pieces, the more you will ultimately have at your disposal to inspire a scenic revelation of note.

<p>Game LibraryAccusation (reveal something about the character or past actions): 1. Mine previous details and fit with it,  It can be dynamic to craft an accusation in such a way that creates tension or juxtaposition with known details – the model straight “A” student has some skeletons in their closet – but be cautious of making a revelation that undermines a played reality2.  seek accusations that affect your character perosnally Accusations should have influence on the status quo of the current relationship
 upset the pre-established power or status dynamics at play. The accusation should shift how the characters view each other. On deeper levels, it’s also likely to adjust status relationships and probably who even has the power in the scene or relationship. This holds true whether the accusation is “negative” (“You stole the answers”) or “positive” (“I know you told Chelsea that you want to kiss me”).</p>

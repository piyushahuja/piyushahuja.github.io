I";<p>Pattern:</p>

<p>I want to connect with everyone. I want them to like me. If someone doesn’t like me, I want to do things to make them like me.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any connection is between two person’s with free-will. A connection is not your sole responsbility: it is carried by two. There is a division of responsibility. By fixing a connection, doing all the work, you’re taking on their responsibility for them.</li>
  <li>To do things to get someone to like you is manipulative: it has an agenda “to get”. If not explicity, it is a form of implicity contract, and when unfulfilled, leads to resentment.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Antidote: Embodied self-awareness.</p>

<p>How to be more embodied? movement, dance and deep breathing</p>

<p>self awareness: What are you noticing, within and outside?  thoughts, feelings, senses, energetic awareness of other people, of the room.</p>

<p>This is no easy practice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>stay attuned to my own inner (thoughts, feelings) experience</li>
  <li>stay attuned to your outer experience: listening to others on a feeling and energy level and responding , reading the room and the energy in the room, noticing details</li>
  <li>seek the touch of the beloved in every moment’s happening: make love to every moment</li>
</ul>

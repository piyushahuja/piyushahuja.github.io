<p>It is non-reactive and relaxed.
It feels free, in the â€œflow of lifeâ€, genuine, authentic, â€œin integrityâ€.
All emotions are welcome, including: fear, anger, sadness (to investigate: what about â€œstressâ€, â€œanxietyâ€, â€œnervousnessâ€, â€œjealousyâ€). 
It has heightened awareness of emotions. 
You see reality â€œas isâ€, including the emotions of others. 
You have needs, but you are not â€œneedyâ€.</p>

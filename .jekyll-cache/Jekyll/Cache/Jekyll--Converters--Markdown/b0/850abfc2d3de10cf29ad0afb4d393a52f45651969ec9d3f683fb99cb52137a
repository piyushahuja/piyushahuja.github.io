<p>Don’t use dialogue tags. Seriously, try writing a fictional story with 2 or more characters and zero dialogue tags.</p>

<p>For those that don’t know the terminology, dialogue tags are: he said, she asked, I screamed, Brian muttered, etc.</p>

<p>A fellow author told me this trick, and it improved my writing more than any other single piece of advice. When you stop using dialogue tags, not only does it read smoother, but suddenly you have to do two things with every bit of dialogue; 1) convey tone strictly through the dialogue and no tag, and 2) let the reader know who’s talking.</p>

<p>If you’re decent at writing dialogue, then you’re probably already conveying tone anyway. In my case, I think I was decent at writing dialogue, but when I tried to cut out dialogue tags, I still became more cognizant of how my word choices indicated tone.</p>

<p>Letting the reader know who’s talking is trickier, but finding a way to do it without dialogue tags improves your writing immensely IMHO. The best way to indicate who is talking (without the tag) is to pair that dialogue with a piece of narration about the character that’s speaking.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Joe crossed his arms and narrowed his eyes. “You’re going to tell me what I want to know, or you’re not walking out of here.”</li>
  <li>“Are you kidding me?” Jan rolled her eyes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because you’re not using dialogue tags, you’re forced to think about what your characters are physically doing as they’re talking. Too many times, authors forget about all the interesting little movements and mannerisms people have. That body language can tell your reader just as much as the dialogue itself, especially when it comes to conveying emotion.</p>

<p>Just don’t overdo it. When you’ve got back-to-back dialogue, it’s assumed that if you don’t have a dialogue tag or narration to indicate a new person is talking, then it’s just the same two characters going back and forth, even if somebody else is in the room.</p>

<p>And as with all rules, there are exceptions. Especially in a scene with a bunch of characters, sometimes it really is best to just throw a dialogue tag in there once in a while and move on.</p>

<p>When it comes to dialogue attribution, do people prefer “said <strong>__”, or “</strong>__ said”? Why?</p>

<p>I don’t have a preference, and I can’t see why anyone would. Why be dogmatic when you can be practical instead? Use whatever tool is appropriate for the task at hand. I don’t have a preference for hammers over wrenches. It depends on whether I want to pound or tighten. If my goal is to focus the reader’s attention on the fact that Bill is talking, I may write, “Bill said, ‘I’m hungry.’” If, instead, the point is the his hunger, I’ll write, “‘I’m hungry,’ said Bill.” Also, the two create differing levels of suspense: “Listen,” Bill said. “You’re a beautiful girl. I don’t want to beat around the bush, so I’m just gonna ask. Will you sleep with me?” She said, “No.” “Listen,” Bill said. “You’re a beautiful girl. I don’t want to beat around the bush, so I’m just gonna ask. Will you sleep with me?” 
“No,” she said.</p>

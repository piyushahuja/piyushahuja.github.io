I"∑<p>They love me‚Ä¶they love me not.</p>

<p>I feel by now I have a pretty good handle on the question. I don‚Äôt have to pick the petals of a poor flower: my body could tell.</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>You sort of know‚Ä¶don‚Äôt you‚Äù</em> said my friend Dawne. That you just <em>know</em> when you‚Äôd hit it off with someone - pre-communication, pre-familiarity, pre-any dating rituals - was an idea that wafted through my skeptical mind - completely bypassed it - and struck a chord in the same area where the knowingness resided: it was true and I just knew it.</p>

<p>This is my attempt to reflect on the times I‚Äôve been wrong, if I ever have been, and how to tell one from the other.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">Memento Mori</a>: Everyone you know is going to die</strong> People who are close to me would  die before me, and I’d regret not being nicer to them. Everything else is insignificant in comparison.</p>

    <p>The ones you feel for the most, your parents, would probably be the first.  Your elder relatives will go. Your childhood friends will go. Your college mates, your ex-es, your crushes. All will go.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Realizing the people we love will be gone someday puts a much higher value on the time we spend with them.A few years ago I spoke with Frank Ostaseski from the Zen Hospice project. I asked him about one of my greatest fears that one or both of my parents wouldn’t be around to see me fall in love, get married, and have kids. It’s hard not to think about when you’re 40, and these things haven’t happened. But rather than tell me how to deal with the fear, he said I should spend time with my aging parents now, not only after some significant milestone had occurred. It’s not like we’re the Brady Bunch. My sister moved far away for medical school and was gone for the better part of the last decade. After years of living at home, I’m sure my parents were as tired of me as I was of them. Sometimes I”m messy which drives my mom crazy. And other times I make decisions that don’t make any sense to my dad. Despite our differences, the doors always open and food is always on the table. So after my 40th birthday, I decided to start going home for dinner every Sunday.</p>

At the end of life the majority of interactions will be nonverbal as the body shuts down and the person lacks the physical strength, and often even the lung capacity, for long utterances. “People will whisper, and they’ll be brief, single words—that’s all they have energy for.  Medications limit communication. So does dry mouth and lack of dentures. Many people die in such silence, particularly if they have advanced dementia or Alzheimer’s that robbed them of language years earlier. For those who do speak, it seems their vernacular is often banal. From a doctor I heard that people often say, “Oh fuck, oh fuck.” Often it’s the names of wives, husbands, children. “A nurse from the hospice told me that the last words of dying men often resembled each other,” wrote Hajo Schumacher in a September essay in Der Spiegel. “Almost everyone is calling for ‘Mommy’ or ‘Mama’ with the last breath.” Delirium nvolves a loss of consciousness, the inability to find words, restlessness, and a withdrawal from social interaction. Delirium strikes people of all ages after surgery and is also common at the end of life, a frequent sign of dehydration and over-sedation.  “it may even be regarded as exceptional for patients to remain mentally clear throughout the final stages of malignant illness.” “I certainly was somewhat tired after the operation and everything … and I did not know where I was. I thought it became like misty, in some way… the outlines were sort of fuzzy.</li>

  <li>Life is tragic. You can’t have everything; <strong>make the most of what life throws at you.</strong>

      <li>Live a life of no regrets. There can be regret with anything you do.

When you are young, you have all the possibilities of what to do with your life. But as you progress with your life you have to make decisions about what do you want to do, and as you walk through some doors you close most other doors. For example by choosing to become a software dev, you most certainly wont become a doctor, lawyer, cook, house builder or truck driver, although all these options were open to you a couple of years back, now those doors are mostly closed. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18837334">The Road Not Taken</a> is about the self-deception we practice when constructing the story of our own lives.

  <li><strong>Don’t wait to take the risks</strong> ‘til some perfect time. No perfect time is coming, and the clock IS ticking. Take the f—ing risks. Be utterly foolish. Be embarrassed by the bigness of your dreams, but not stopped by that embarrassment. Blush if you must, but don’t ever be held back by “what other people might say.” To be on the wire is life; the rest is waiting. <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-you-didn-t-think-you-d-get-but-you-got-because-you-asked">Ask for what you need</a>.

      <li>Take more risks, especially when you’re early on in your career; being young and unknown is actually a major advantage because you have very little to lose.</li>
      <li>You are growing old. There’s no time to be anxious. Go out and tell the truth. Just be. Communicate how you feel. Think of yourself less (not of yourself less). Remove the “I”. Just perceive. Life is grand and you are an explorer! Play! And Delight! </li>
      <li>“I am nostalgic for my twenties (most of them, anyway; twenty and twenty-one were squandered at college; twenty-four was kind of a wash, too) but I can tell you for sure that they weren’t as great as I now crack them up to be. I was always broke, I was often lonely, and I had some really terrible clothes. But my life was shiny and unblemished. Everything was ahead of me. I walked around with an abiding feeling that, at any given time, anything could go in any direction. And it was often true.” - <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/09/meghan-daum-unspeakable/">Meghan Baum</a></li>
      <li>Don’t let fear of failing stop you from taking risks. That is a risk itself, because you will miss out by not acting. If you do fail or end up in a crisis, you’ll probably be OK. The more crises I’ve faced in my life, the less scary each subsequent one has become. I’m secure in the knowledge I’ve made it through disaster before and I believe I will again. If you do something new and ambitious, be ready for doomsayers. Doing new things is hard both because you have to figure out how to do it and you have to deal with a constant barrage of negativity.</li>
      <li>Simple tip – don’t be afraid to ask for what you want. If you’re doing something ambitious, you’ll be told “no”, a lot. Sometimes though, people will give you what you want. Those times will outweigh the pains of being rejected, so be aggressive.</li>

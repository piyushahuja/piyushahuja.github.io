  <li>Is your authentic self something you were born with and you need to fulfill (an essential self), or is it something you create for yourself throughout your life (an existential self)?
    <ul>
      <li>The call of personal authenticity ‚Äî of being true to one‚Äôs self ‚Äî conceals the chasms between the essential self and the existential self, which are psychologically divergent interpretations of the Self. Existentialist authenticity prescribes to the individual man and woman ‚Äúdetermine your destiny!‚Äù, by being aware of the absolute freedom to choose.</li>
      <li>Essentialist authenticity demands that a person find and follow a prescribed system of values in order to reach a pre-ordained destiny.</li>
      <li>The essentialist person searches for signs of self-betrayal; the existentialist person asks: ‚ÄúHow am I not myself?‚Äù and answers ‚ÄúOnly when I act in bad faith‚Äù.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Does your obligation to be true to yourself override your obligations to others?
    <ul>
      <li>In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which a person‚Äôs actions are congruent with his or her values and desires, despite external pressures to social conformity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Where does authenticity end and narcissism start? Modern western capitalist fetish with individualism, excessive idea of self-importance, outward-focussed.
    <ul>
      <li>We are both defined by certain factors over which we have no control but we also have freedom to interpret and expand our situation. We can make ourselves but we dont have complete control over our self making. Factic ‚ÄúI have no control‚Äù vs the other extreme ‚ÄúI can create myself anew out of nothing‚Äù. The task at hand that we are both factic and free.</li>
      <li>Authenticity is the opposite of narcissism. We are tempted to reify the idea of self to reduce our freedom rather than expand it. Narcissism is dependent on the idea of the self, authenticity is the idea of the self.  (Sartre)</li>
      <li>Judge for yourself but that does not mean self-welfare.</li>

<p>Erich Fromm
A very different definition of authenticity was proposed by Erich Fromm. in the mid-1900s. He considered behavior of any kind, even that wholly in accord with societal mores, to be authentic if it results from personal understanding and approval of its drives and origins, rather than merely from conformity with the received wisdom of the society. Thus a Frommean authentic may behave consistently in a manner that accords with cultural norms, for the reason that those norms appear on consideration to be appropriate, rather than simply in the interest of conforming with current norms. Fromm thus considers authenticity to be a positive outcome of enlightened and informed motivation rather than a negative outcome of rejection of the expectations of others. He described the latter condition ‚Äì the drive primarily to escape external restraints typified by the ‚Äúabsolute freedom‚Äù of Sartre ‚Äì as ‚Äúthe illusion of individuality‚Äù,[19] as opposed to the genuine individuality that results from authentic living.</p>

<p>How does one fail to act authentically?</p>

<p>Motivation for action:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to please others (Aristotle).</li>
  <li>driven by the opinion of others or what you want from others?</li>
  <li>When the ‚Äúother‚Äù is God. Do you do this because you think that action is right, or because you are afraid God will punish you otherwise? (Pure fear vs Servile fear qua Augustine)</li>
  <li>Social existence corrupts human beings so that our natural drive for compassion is overriden by other drives like ‚Äúwhat others think of us‚Äù (Rouseu)</li>
  <li>Distrust of reason and rationality. Reason is used us to divert us from our true nature (Rousseu 18th century)</li>
  <li>Social existence was by and large a negative thing, encouraged conformity. It was for the individual to stand out from the crowd. Kierkegard 19th Century</li>
  <li>Heidegger: One of the reasons we are inauthentic is because we cant tolerate the thought of our mortality/finitude. We are confronted with a range of demands, as a son, father etc. We dont choose that. 
We dont make that decision, we live the dream of indeterminacy.   Deaths definitely coming, not yet, there‚Äôs still time. Still time to change, be different, be other than who they are now.</li>
  <li>Sartre: Being inauthentic is to choose to act in a way that does not recognize the sort of beings humans are: they have radical freedom.  Its not that authentic people act radically, but they act out of a recognition of the kind of beings human beings are. People with bad faith avoid the recognition that we are free, we going to die, we are constantly responsible for the task of deciding .</li>
  <li>Kant‚Äôs autonomous agent is actually the same in all (we are all bound by the same constraints, there‚Äôs a universal formal condition) whereas authenticity, as existentialists understand it, is all about individual and unique to an individual.</li>
  <li>Nietzche: Rails against conformism and against the idea that the rules of how we ought to be would be the same for everyone.</li>
  <li>Goethe‚Äôs Werther: Individual wrestling with his in own inner passion</li>
</ul>

<p>How does one act or be authentic?</p>

<p>Motivation for action:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A virtuous person does things for their own sake</li>
  <li>When you act on your own assessment (not others‚Äô)</li>
  <li>Are you the author, or origin, of your actions?</li>
  <li>True Christian faces pure/chaste fear - they love what God loves (not doing because they are scared of God/scared of punishment) Augustine</li>
  <li>We are more authentic when we are more in touch with our passionate side.</li>
  <li>Authentic‚Äù are willing to make demands, death may come now (Heidegger)</li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone would get in touch with their own genius, a labour of self creation, get in touch with your most basic loves and passion and submit them to a discipline of becoming an ideal version of oneself.  Resisted the idea that we were fully formed in utero</p>
  </li>
  <li>Owning one‚Äôs own life: Eigenkeight: Making something our own.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fear: emotion we may feel in relation to a particular worry/concern/danger
Anxiety: existential. Anxiety: What interrupts the conformist, anonymous mode is existential terror.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Power (Power could be humility and honesty. )</li>
  <li>Integrity</li>
  <li>Speak your truth</li>
  <li>Be Yourself</li>
  <li>Being there</li>
  <li>Taking care of your needs</li>
  <li>Chamaeleon drive, Moulding to others</li>
  <li>
    <p>Be the source</p>
  </li>
  <li>Different public face from inner life (vs appearing as you are)</li>
  <li>A feeling that ‚Äúthis is you‚Äù, acting in accordance with your values and beliefs (why we might not act according to are values and beliefs? as opposed for pleasing others, obtaining something, pressure to conform)</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

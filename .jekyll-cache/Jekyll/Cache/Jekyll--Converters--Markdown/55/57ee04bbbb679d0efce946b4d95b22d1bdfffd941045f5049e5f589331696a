<p><strong>Education</strong></p>

<p>I read for a second BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford.  I was supported by the KC Mahindra Scholarship, <a href="https://www.tiarafoundation.com/copy-of-tiara-special-grant">Tiara Special Grant</a>, and a second undergraduate degree scholarship by Harris Manchester College. <a href="/philosophy">These are some essays</a> I wrote while at Oxford.</p>

<p>Before Oxford, I graduated from IIT Delhi with a five-year Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Computing in 2013. My master’s thesis was in the design of approximation algorithms for networks under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen_Garg">Naveen Garg</a>.</p>

 One of the best way to learn is to teach it to someone. Platonia allows one to organize one-on-one meetups with people for learning-and-teaching. Give it a try! Here's the [download link for iOS]((http://itunes.com/apps/platonia)) and here's the [download link for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.platonia_client). -->

<!-- - **Teaching:**  I am interested in teaching or mentoring opportunies in philosophy, algorithms, and creative writing.

- **Learning:** I am looking for people interested in practicing Improv, First Aid, or Wilderness survival skills.  

- **Creative Collaborations:** If you'd like to collaborate on something for *fun*, please don't hesitate to reach out. Here are some ideas: a podcast, a comedy sketch, a mobile app, or any long-form writing assignment.

Most writers have this goal: to transfer an image from their minds into the minds of readers. And they want readers to be as struck by that image as possible.Â  If a writer sends me â€œcat,â€ I may receive the word, but just receiving isnâ€™t good enough. I may receive it and forget about it a moment later. Writers want to transfer images, and they want those images to STICK.Â  Which means they must describe those images in a way thatâ€™s as vivid and sensual as possible. (Sensual, because we experience through our senses, so if you can con a reader into believing heâ€™s seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling or touching, you win.) Most writing-rules boil down to this: â€œlick the reader.â€ If you lick his face, heâ€™ll remember you.Â  For instance, we avoid the passive-voice because it doesnâ€™t lick the readerâ€™s face. (Though, perhaps, the readerâ€™s face is licked.)Â  When I first wrote the paragraph two places above this one, I started it â€œWhich means images must be describedâ€¦â€ itâ€™s hard to imagine images being described. Being described by whom?Â  The easiest sentences to see are the ones in which an agent does something TO something. So I rewrote it as â€œthey [the writers] must describeâ€¦â€ Itâ€™s still not great, because â€œdescribeâ€ is a weak verb â€“ one that doesnâ€™t evoke a strong image â€“ but at least Iâ€™m evoking the idea of a writer DOING SOMETHING and not of something just happening.Â  But you donâ€™t have to remember to avoid modifiers if, instead, you write to spark the senses. â€œAvoid modifiersâ€ is an okay way of achieving of forcing yourself to write more sensually, because if youâ€™re robbed of modifiers, you have to pick vivid nouns and verbs to get your idea across. A person can point to a tree, and a person can run, but a person canâ€™t dangerously. Itâ€™s impossible to imagine dangerously. There is no such thing as dangerously. Itâ€™s possible to imagine dancing dangerously or holding a knife dangerously, but these phrases put a burdon on the reader. He must first evoke â€œholding a knife.â€ Then he must add â€œdangerouslyâ€ to it. You run the risk that he wonâ€™t: that heâ€™ll just mush everything together into some vague â€œunderstandingâ€ of what youâ€™re trying to evoke. The worst thing a writer can achieve is his reader â€œgetting the point.â€ You donâ€™t want the reader to get the point. You want to lick his face. Which of the following is easier to imagine? â€œtalking quietlyâ€ or â€œwhisperingâ€? â€œwalking nervouslyâ€ or â€œpacingâ€?
â€œacting aggressivelyâ€ or â€œfightingâ€?</p>

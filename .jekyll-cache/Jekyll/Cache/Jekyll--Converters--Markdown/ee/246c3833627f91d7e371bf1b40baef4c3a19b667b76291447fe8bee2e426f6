Make sure you are crystal clear on what sort of book your friend is trying to write. If youâ€™re at all confused about that, ask questions. Even if you are sure, it doesnâ€™t hurt to ask: â€œBefore I comment, can you tell me a little about your goals? It seems to me like youâ€™re writing a sci-fi novel about the effects of overpopulation, and youâ€™d like the reader to understand that our rising birth rates are causing problems. Is that right?â€</p>

<p>Then only make comments that you think will help your friend better achieve his goals. Make sure none of your comments address the goals themselves and donâ€™t push him towards different goals.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not a fan of didactic (moralistic or idea-based) novels. In fact, I think theyâ€™re worthless. However, if I realized a friendâ€™s goal was to write something like â€œThe Fountainhead,â€ Iâ€™d either forgo commenting on it, or, if I did comment, Iâ€™d with the intent of helping him write a well-crafted didactic book. I would even help him make it more didactic if I thought that was in line with his goal.</p>

<p>If your friend is under a tight, unmovable deadline, donâ€™t make comments that would involve weeks of work, like â€œYou need to totally rewrite the first five chapters.â€</p>

<p>Donâ€™t psychoanalyze him in your comments. Say, â€œI wasnâ€™t satisfied by Chapter Fiveâ€™s sex scene,â€ not â€œI wasnâ€™t satisfied by Chapter Fiveâ€™s sex scene, and I think thatâ€™s because youâ€™re uncomfortable writing about sex.â€</p>

<p>Donâ€™t say anything just to â€œhave an opinion.â€ (Yikes I canâ€™t think of anything to say, and I feel stupid saying nothing, soâ€¦ â€œI think Chapter Three is a little slow.â€)</p>

<p>Make sure all your comments are specific in at least one of two ways: either explain exactly whatâ€™s wrong with (or what could be improved about) some aspect or explain your reaction in a detailed way. (Or both.) In other words, itâ€™s not helpful for you to say, â€œThere was something about Chapter Nine that didnâ€™t satisfy me, but Iâ€™m not sure what.â€ Rather, say, â€œI wasnâ€™t satisfied by the fight in Chapter Nine. I wanted Peter to win, and he didnâ€™t.â€</p>

<p>If something works, say so. Itâ€™s hard for most people to swallow a river of negativity.</p>

<p>Finally, I am in complete agreement with Claire J. Vannette. Her suggestion is wise for anyone critiquing anything.</p>

<p>Theories of Truth:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Correspondence: truth consists in correspondence to the facts</li>
  <li>Coherence: truth consists in coherence with a set of beliefs or propositions</li>
  <li>Deflationary: According to the deflationist, however, such suggestions are mistaken, and, moreover, they all share a common mistake. The common mistake is to assume that truth has a nature of the kind that philosophers might find out about and develop theories of. For the deflationist, truth has no nature beyond what is captured in ordinary claims such as that ‚Äòsnow is white‚Äô is true just in case snow is white. Philosophers looking for the nature of truth are bound to be frustrated, the deflationist says, because they are looking for something that isn‚Äôt there.</li>
</ul>

<p>Linguistic analysis: truth value of statements about existence depends on the theory of truth: correspondence theory (truth relies on the correspondence between a statement an an external, independent reality), or internalist theory (context theory or intuitionist?)</p>

<h1 id="universals-and-properties">Universals and Properties</h1>

<p><strong>Should the properties an object has in common with other objects, such as color and shape, be considered to exist beyond those objects? And if a property exists separately from objects, what is the nature of that existence?</strong></p>

<p>Universals are qualities or relations found in two or more entities. As an example, if all cup holders are circular in some way, circularity may be considered a universal property of cup holders. Further, if two daughters can be considered female offspring of Frank, the qualities of being female, offspring, and of Frank, are universal properties of the two daughters. Many properties can be universal: being human, red, male or female, liquid or solid, big or small, etc.</p>

<p>Philosophers agree that human beings can talk and think about universals, but disagree on whether universals exist in reality beyond mere thought and speech.</p>

<p>The problem of universals is specifically accounting for the fact that some things are of the same type. For example, Fluffy and Kitzler are both cats, or, the fact that certain properties are repeatable, such as: the grass, the shirt, and Kermit the Frog are green.</p>

<p>One wants to know by virtue of what are Fluffy and Kitzler both cats, and what makes the grass, the shirt, and Kermit green?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Platonist argument: universals are required for certain general words to have meaning and for the sentences in which they occur to be true or false. Take the sentence ‚ÄúDjivan Gasparyan is a musician‚Äù for instance. The realist may claim that this sentence is only meaningful and expresses a truth because there is an individual, Djivan Gasparyan, who possesses a certain quality: musicianship. Therefore, it is assumed that the property is a universal which is distinct from the particular individual who has the property.
The Platonist answer is that all the green things are green in virtue of the existence of a universal: a single abstract thing that, in this case, is a part of all the green things. With respect to the color of the grass, the shirt and Kermit, one of their parts is identical. In this respect, the three parts are literally one. Greenness is repeatable because there is one thing that manifests itself wherever there are green things.
Plato famously held, on one interpretation, that there is a realm of abstract forms or universals apart from the physical world (see theory of the forms). Particular physical objects merely exemplify or instantiate the universal.
    <ul>
      <li>But where do they exist?
        <ul>
          <li>One possibility is that it is outside space and time.
            <ul>
              <li>However, naturalists assert that nothing is outside of space and time.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Precisely because some form is immanent in several physical objects, it must also transcend each of those physical objects; in this way, the forms are ‚Äútranscendent‚Äù only insofar as they are ‚Äúimmanent‚Äù in many physical objects. In other words, immanence implies transcendence; they are not opposed to one another. In this view, there would there not be a separate ‚Äúworld‚Äù or ‚Äúrealm‚Äù of forms that is distinct from the physical world, thus shirking much of the worry about where to locate a ‚Äúuniversal realm‚Äù. Moderate realists hold that there is no realm in which universals exist, but rather universals are located in space and time wherever they are manifest. Now, recall that a universal, like greenness, is supposed to be a single thing.
            <ul>
              <li>But isnt it strange that there could be a single thing that exists in multiple places simultaneously? The realist maintains that all the instances of greenness are held together by the exemplification relation, but this relation cannot be explained.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>(Bleh) Some Neoplatonists, such as the pagan philosopher Plotinus and the Christian philosopher Augustine, imply (anticipating conceptualism) that universals are contained within the mind of God.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Nominalism arose in reaction to this problem. It denies 
the existence of universals.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fluffy and Kitzler, for example, are both cats simply because the predicate ‚Äòis a cat‚Äô applies to both of them. And this is the case for all similarity of attribute among objects. The main criticism of this view is that it does not provide a sufficient solution to the problem of universals. It fails to provide an account of what makes it the case that a group of things warrant having the same predicate applied to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>‚ÄòCat‚Äô applies to both cats because Fluffy and Kitzler resemble an exemplar cat closely enough to be classed together with it as members of its kind, or that they differ from each other (and other cats) quite less than they differ from other things, and this warrants classing them together.
    <ul>
      <li>Some resemblance nominalists will concede that the resemblance relation is itself a universal, but is the only universal necessary. Others argue that each resemblance relation is a particular</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Conceptualists hold a position intermediate between nominalism and realism, saying that universals exist only within the mind and have no external or substantial reality. Conceptualism is a philosophical theory that explains universality of particulars as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind. The conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of universals from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside of the mind‚Äôs perception of them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Metaphysical Realism and Anti-Realism</strong></p>

<p>Frege‚Äôs semantic realism (for Dummett, the only sense in which we can investigate realism) can be defined ‚Äúas the belief that statement of disputed class, undecidable sentences, possess an objective truth-value, independently of our means of knowing it: they are true or false in virtue of a reality exciting independently of us.  Our sentential understanding consists in our knowledge of sentences‚Äô truth conditions, where truth is treated as potentially evidence-transcendent or
epistemically unconstrained.</p>

<p>For Dummett, realism is best understood as semantic realism, i.e., as the view accepting that every declarative sentence in one‚Äôs language is bivalent (determinately true or false) and evidence-transcendent (independent of our means of coming to know which), while anti-realism rejects this view in favour of a concept of knowable (or assertible) truth. Historically, these debates had been understood as disagreements about whether a certain type of entity objectively exists or not. Thus we may speak of (anti-)realism with respect to other minds, the past, the future, universals, mathematical entities (such as natural numbers), moral categories, the material world, or even thought.</p>

<p>Realist have a belief that truth-conditions can be considered as evidence-transcendent.</p>

<p>Challenges to realism:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Manifestation Challenge: Knowledge of meaning of a sentence has to manifest in linguistic behavior.
When one utters a sentence about the world, there is no evidence of any link between what one says and the actual state of affairs. It could entirely be possible that the use of a sentence and its truth value is determined by the speaker according to prior linguistic practice, not according to the meaning of a sentence in the sense of correspondence with facts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Competence in one‚Äôs language would be impossible to acquire if realism were true</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brain in a vat</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conceptual Pluralism</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Model Indeterminacy</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is existence a property of individuals? If yes, are there individuals that lack it?</strong></p>

<p>Useful abstractions to dissect this question:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The relationship between an individual‚Äôs essence (being) and its existence</li>
</ul>

<p>A thing‚Äôs essential properties are inseparable from the bearer, not only in the sense that the property is necessarily had by that object (insofar as that object were to exist), but in the deeper sense that any adequate account of what that object is involves that property; they are part of any adequate definition of the thing or answer to the question ‚ÄòWhat is it?‚Äô. e.g. I am essentially a human and perhaps essentially the person I in fact am, if there are individual essences in addition to general essences.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The distinction between accident and essence and that distinction‚Äôs relation to contingency and necessity.</li>
</ul>

<p>All essences are necessary and all contingent properties are accidents (not necessary). But there is no strict one-to-one correspondence: there could be necessary properties which are not essential: I am necessarily identical to something and necessarily such that 2+2=4, but these properties are among my accidents, as they are not part of any adequate account of what I am and what distinguishes me from others.</p>

<p><strong>Position: No, existence is not a property.</strong></p>

<p>Argument 1 (Aristotle): Nothing more to existence than essence: ‚Äúthere is not a space between an articulation of what a thing is and that thing‚Äôs existing‚Äù</p>

<p>Argument 2 (Hume) There is no impression of existence distinct from the impression of an object, which is ultimately on Hume‚Äôs view a bundle of qualities. As all of our contentful ideas derive from impressions</p>

<p>Argument 3 (Kant) Proponents of the ontological argument argue that the concept of God as an entity with all perfections or a being of which no greater can be conceived entails God‚Äôs existence, as existence is a perfection and a being that exists is greater than a being that does not exist. Kant objected that existence is not a property: ‚ÄúThus when I think a thing, through whichever and however many predicates I like (even in its thoroughgoing determination), not the least bit gets added to the thing when I posit in addition that this thing is. For otherwise what would exist would not be the same as what I had thought in my concept, but more than that, and I could not say that the very object of my concept exists‚Äù</p>

<p>Argument 4 (Frege, Russell):  existence is not a property of individuals but instead a second-order property: a property of concepts (Frege). second-order property of propositional functions, to say that dinosaurs do not exist is to say that the property of being a dinosaur is not instantiated; to say that Jean-Baptiste Botul does not exist is to say that some property‚Äîsay, the property of being a unique post-war critic of Kant and father of Butolism‚Äîis not instantiated. In neither case is it to say of some individual that it does not exist, which neither Frege nor Russell thought made sense. The view that existence is not a property of individuals became the common view in the early 20th Century. the thought, developed most forcefully by Russell, that denying that existence is a first-order property is the only way to avoid the consequence that there are things that do not exist and thus that there is a distinction between being and existing, our second framing question from above.</p>

<p><strong>Position: Yes, existence is a property. There are things which do not exist.</strong></p>

<p>Argument: One can have an understanding of what a man or a phoenix is without knowing whether it exists. So, existence is something in addition to essence. Existence is not part of most objects‚Äôs natures and so those objects can be conceived or thought of separately from their existing. (Aquinas)</p>

<p>Existence is a genuine property of individuals but not universally had (Meinong)</p>
<ul>
  <li>primary motivation is the puzzle of negative singular existentials‚Äîsentences that seem to truly assert the nonexistence of an individual, such as the sentence ‚ÄòJean-Baptiste Botul does not exist‚Äô. In order to be true, it seems, the subject position must designate some entity of which nonexistence is truly predicated, in which case there are things‚Äîthe designation of these singular terms‚Äîthat do not exist. Frege and Russell, by contrast, take the same sentences to demonstrate that those expressions are not genuine singular terms at all and that negative existentials all have a general form, asserting the noninstantiation of a property.</li>
</ul>

<p>Absolutely everything exists.</p>

<p>A sentence like ‚ÄòRonald McDonald does not exist‚Äô either expresses a fully articulate singular proposition and so is false, as in that case there is a referent of the subject-place singular term which exists, or does not express a truth evaluative proposition at all, as the singular term lacks a semantic content. In neither case is the sentence true. Avoiding that consequence was a primary motivation behind all of the alternative accounts discussed in the previous two sections.
    +  The first challenge facing a proponent of such a view, then, is to explain how sentences like ‚ÄòRonald McDonald does not exist‚Äô are both meaningful and sometimes apparently true without abandoning the theses that absolutely everything exists and that all names are devices of direct reference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kripe: ‚ÄòRonald McDonald‚Äô refer to existent, albeit abstract, fictional characters. Fictional characters have both being and existence. On this view, then, there are no genuinely true singular negative existentials. what a speaker means when she utters the sentence ‚ÄòRonald McDonald does not exist‚Äô is not the false proposition that that sentence expresses but instead the true proposition that (the fictional character) Ronald McDonald is not a real person or is not concrete. Indeed, this is suggested by the natural amendment, ‚Äò‚ÄòRonald McDonald does not exist; he‚Äôs a creation of advertisement!‚Äô‚Äô</li>
</ul>

<p>All meaningful singular existentials are true and their negations false. We mistakenly take some singular negative existentials to be true because we conflate or do not sharply distinguish existing from being concrete. The benefit of this account is the simple semantics of proper names and the sparse metaphysics. The cost is revisionism regarding what we mean when we use apparently true singular negative existentials.</p>

<hr />

<p>Internal vs external ontological questions.
Quine view of ontology.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The notion of ‚Äòone reality‚Äô behind our everyday perceptions is common in everyday life, and some find it unsettling that what ‚Äòexists‚Äô might be a matter of what language one chooses to use.
    <ul>
      <li>Putnam points out that while the pages of a book are regarded as part of book when they are attached, they are things-in-themselves if they are detached. My nose is only part of an object, my person. On the other hand, is my nose the same as the collection of atoms or molecules forming it? This arbitrariness of language is called conceptual relativity, a matter of conventions.[13] The point is made that if one wishes to refer only to ‚Äòpages‚Äô, then books may not exist, and vice versa if one wishes to admit only to books. Thus, in this view, the Carnapian multiplicity of possible linguistic frameworks proposes a variety of ‚Äòrealities‚Äô and the prospect of choosing between them, a form of what is called ontological pluralism, or multiple realities.</li>

<h1 id="time">Time</h1>

<p><strong>Is it absurd to suppose that only the present exists?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To say that only present exists, is that the only thing in our world is there here and now, and any talk about the past or the future is much¬†like a fictional talk, which has its referent as something which doesn‚Äôt exist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>McTaggart‚Äôs proof about hte unreality of time: When McTaggart says ‚Äò‚ÄòTime involves change‚Äô‚Äô, it seems like a sleight of hand. What does it mean? Time is the dimension of change. But that doesn‚Äôt make anything clearer.
We observe time through A series and B series, or we observe the dimension of change through A series and B series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does tense indicate a feature of the world? Do tensed statements have tenseless truth conditions? Would that show that tense is unreal?</p>

<h1 id="persistence-through-time">Persistence Through Time</h1>

<p><strong>Material objects extend through space by having different spatial parts in different places. But how do they persist through time? According to some philosophers, things have temporal parts as well as spatial parts</strong></p>

<p>If you have different temporal parts, this would explain how you can exist at different times, and it would also explain how you can have different properties at different times (you-yesterday hasn‚Äôt heard of temporal parts, you-tomorrow is an expert)</p>

<p>** can we give criteria of identity through time for artefacts, animals or people? What happens to a ship if you replace all of its planks one by one? What if you keep the old planks, then build a new ship out of them?** In addressing these questions during recent decades, however, it has proven useful to discuss whether objects have temporal parts, because the answers that philosophers give to these questions can often depend upon whether they believe in temporal parts.</p>

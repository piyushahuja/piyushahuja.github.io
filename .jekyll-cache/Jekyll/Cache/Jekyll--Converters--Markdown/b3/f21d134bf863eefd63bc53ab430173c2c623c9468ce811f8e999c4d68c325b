I"Ç<p>pattern: I want to connect with everyone.</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you meet people when their intention is ready to receive you. You invite, suggest, nudge, say hello.  pushing or grabbing doesnâ€™t work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>going slow helps. this is the virtue of small talk.  â€œHey, we havnâ€™t met. Iâ€™m Piyushâ€ is a good enough starter, and then let it bounce back and forth becauseâ€¦</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a connection is not your sole responsbility: it is carried by two. There is a division of responsibility. By trying to fix a connection, doing all the work, you might â€œcrowd outâ€ their work, take their responsibility for them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>antidote:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learnt to listen to the body. The body is taking all kinds of signals from the environment, and it stores that knowledge. The body â€œknowsâ€ who accepts you and who doesnâ€™t, regardless of how one presents themselves to you. Some of the women I felt anxious had said nothing to me, but the body â€œknewâ€ that for one reason or the other, it didnt feel safe in their presence, and that caused anxiety. And often, the reason had some meat: they held a judgement about me, for example.</li>
</ul>

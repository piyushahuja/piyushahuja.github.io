Cristina Hartmann, I string words together and hope for the best.
57 upvotes by Shishene Jing, Kaicheng Liang, Achilleas Vortselas, (more)
As someone who has written numerous research papers, I've become too familiar with the pains of academic writing. (These 80-page theses and 30-plus-page legal memos were downright Sisyphusian at times.)
 
 
 
 I don't want to repeat others' suggestions, especially the excellent tips from Kaicheng Liang. So, I'll focus on the more nitty-gritty details. (Note: some of my suggestions are good practices for any kind of writing.)
 
 
 1. Hammer out your general thesis before you start writing
 
 I assume that you're done with your research by the time you start writing. You should have an idea of what you want your paper to say. An academic paper must have a clear and cogent position on an issue. Otherwise, you're not contributing to the knowledge trove. (This is particularly essential for the social sciences and humanities, but also important for the hard sciences.)
 If you don't have a thesis before you start writing, you vacilliate and waffle. Quite bad qualities for a focused academic paper. You end up with a paper with a lot of facts, but doesn't really say anything. These are B or C papers, no matter how artfully written. 
 
 With a thesis in mind, you can pick the perfect examples and insightful details as you write. Knowing your thesis isn't enough. You must remind the reader of the thesis throughout the paper. Consistent thesis boomeranging makes your paper more cohesive and understandable. This is crucial in long papers (10+ pages) because the reader may forget the paper's point as he or she reads.
 
 
 2. Create an outline before a single word hits a page
 
 Ok, now that you've figured out what to say, you need to construct an outline. Sounds easy, right? Nope. This was always the hardest part for me -- the big-picture organization.
 
 An outline forces you to think about progression. What issues and facts are essential foundation for your argument? What are the major themes? These are hard questions to answer, but your paper will be better for it. Don't be afraid to try out a few different outlines. It'll clarify your thinking.
 
 
 3. Add headings to longer academic papers
 
 This is where your outline will become an invaluable tool. If you have a longer paper, you should add descriptive headings. (Almost like chapter titles.) Generally speaking, headings are brief descriptions of the section's general topic, such as "Interracial Men and Women in Antebellum South." 
 Headings make it easier for readers to parse your paper. A readable academic paper is a good paper. (I've slogged through too many of the unreadable kind...)
 
 4. Write the introduction last
 
 Oh, you thought that since you formulated a thesis and an outline, the introduction would be easy-peasy? It's not. In all likelihood, you'll have to rewrite the whole thing at the end anyway. Save yourself the time and energy and proceed directly to the first section.
 
 No matter how much thought and effort I put into my theses and outlines, I always adjust my ideas as I write. It's just the nature o things (unless the paper is simplisitic). That's okay. Fine-tuning means that you're thinking as you write (always a good thing). Also, some things that may seem logical and obvious in our minds end up seeming random and ridiculous on the page. 
 
 By the time you write the conclusion, you will know the topic like the back of your hand. You'll be able to state your ideas and essential facts in a straightforward and concise manner. It may feel a bit strange to leave that spot on the top of the document blank, but it'll save you the time and effort of totally redoing your introduction. 
 
 5. Acknowledge and respond to alternative arguments
 
 Unless you've made a brand-new scientific discovery (if so, congratulations!), there will be other ideas and theories out there. A through paper must acknowledge and respond to these other ideas.
 
 It can be as simple as "Professor X says this, but evidence shows that Y is a more accurate interpretation." This approach shows that you know the field,  a must in academia. (Responses are particularly important in legal academic writing.) You can also use this technique to strengthen your argument by showing how correct your argument is. 
 
 A qualifier. Responses may be relatively unimportant for undergraduate papers. At that level, you're not expected to be an expert in the field quite yet. For graduate-level work, however, this technique is necessary. 
 
 6. Use short-form citations for all of your citations until the last few revisions
 
 I learned this trick the hard way, so I don't want you to suffer as I did. As I mentioned in #4, your thesis and ideas will change as you write. At worst, you'll reorganize the entire paper; at best, you'll reorder a few paragraphs and sentences. This can skew the citations. 
 
 As you enter the spelling-grammar phase of revision (I'll get to that), all of your reorganizations are complete. You can insert the long-form citations wherever appropriate. It's really not fun searching for that long-form citation that I moved from page 5 to 13. (I shudder at the thought.)
 
 
 7. Use appropriate academic language
 
 Academic writing is quite formal. Yes, you can have a bit of fun with it, but within reason. 
 
 A few quick-and-dirty guidelines:
 no contractions - always use cannot instead of can't. Use do not instead of don't.
- active voice - avoid passive voice whenever possible. It's tempting, I know, but it's a sign of long-winded writing.
- appropriately formal language - I was torn a new one during college by using the word "stud" in an academic paper. Don't be as dumb as me.
- define any acronyms or special phrases - for example, if your paper discusses a law or regulation, always use the full name with the appropiate shortened version in parentheses. For example: "21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act ("CVAA").
 There are many more formal rules for academic prose, but I'd be lecturing until the cows come home. Not fun.
 
 8. Leave plenty of time for revisions (no, not a few hours -- a few days, a few weeks or even a few months)
 
 Recently, I wrote a 15-page legal article for an agency. You know when I completed the first draft? 2 months before the due date. Yep, you read that right. I spent 2 months revising a 8-page article that metamorphosed into a 15-page paper.

Of course, you may be more sane than me and spend less time revising a relatively short article. That being said, you will spend more time revising than you think. Murphy's law in action! 
 
 I found a step-by-step revision system that's pretty effective for me:
1. Global Revision- this is the first re-read (ideally, after a few days away from your paper). This phase focuses on organization. Should the first section be first? Should I switch these two sub-sections?Should I split this section into sub-sections?
2. Thematic Revisions -  The second phase is when you reconsider your thesis. Does your thesis reflect all of the themes in your paper? Do you emphasize the themes enough? This part requires substantial rewriting to ensure that your paper features your thesis front and center.
3. Cohesion Revision - The third phase may be the most subjective and difficult phases for some. A good paper is cohesive and just flows. Hopefully, you've taken care of any global cohesion problems by the global revisions, but you need to look at paragraph and sentence-level cohesion issues. Does this paragraph flow into the next? Is this sentence a logical antecedent to that sentence?
4. Spelling and Grammar Revision - now we get down to the brass tacks. Check for typos, defective parallel construction, improper subject-verb agreement, et cetera. Keep an eye out for unnecessary words as well. This is also the phase where you should check the citations (fun!).
5. Formatting Revisions - is everything in its proper format? (This is the most tedious part for me.)

 Okay, my answer mutated into a mini-dissertation. If anyone has managed to get to this sentence, I applaud your persistence and determination. 
 
 Academic writing, like any other form of writing, isn't easy. It takes a lot of practice and focus to become a good academic writer. Add a bit of determination and reflection, you may even become great. 
 
 
 P.S. LIsten to Dena Tarlin's advice on organizing and recording your research. I remember a few too many moments where I was frantically searching for that "one stupid document" that I needed the night before the paper was due. A sure-fire path to a nervous breakdown.

. Prepare your figures and tables before anything else. Decide how many you need, and what material or data you could use to produce powerful graphics. If you don't yet have intriguing, thought-provoking figures and persuasive tables of your best data, then you are not ready to write a paper. Like any human being, reviewers and experienced readers look at the pictures first, and they can quickly determine the value of your work by your figures without reading even a single word.

 
2. Keep your abstract short, and write it after everything else. You want somebody to skim your abstract in less than 15 seconds, say 'hmm that's interesting' and then start on the Introduction proper (or at least download your paper for later). An effective abstract can win readers from the start. I've seen some monster-sized abstracts that simply defeat the purpose of this mini-section; it's meant to be a hook, not a firehose. 200 words is a reasonable limit. Anything longer comes off clunky and long-winded. Writing the abstract after the rest of the paper is complete will help you crystallize the work better without gushing/rambling.

 
3. A detailed and abundantly-cited Introduction only makes your work look better. Some writers are miserly with cited literature and descriptions of previously published work, for fear of cheapening the perceived impact of their own findings. But a detailed account of the current state of the art will illustrate the breadth and depth of efforts in tackling the problem by the scientific community at large, and by that indirectly emphasize the significance and reach of your conclusions.

 
4. Avoid the first-person, avoid superlatives, avoid vague language.Generally speaking, 'I', 'we', and 'our group' are unprofessional language; the passive voice is almost always preferred. And despite how ground-breaking and dumbfoundingly epic you think your work is, stay clear of phrases like 'tremendous impact', 'possibilities are endless' or even 'important discovery'. As a wise man once said, Show, Not Tell. Focus on fully and accurately describing your findings and the quality of the work will be evident. And always be as complete and unambiguous as possible, especially with your materials and methods. Even if you intend to patent your ultra-fast ultra-accurate algorithms, give at least a complete and clear description of the general framework, and provide some sample code or protocols as a taster. Overly secretive and confusing descriptions will earn yourself derision and a bad rep.

 
5. While writing your paper, constantly ask yourself 'what would a bitchy reviewer say to this?' You can bet that those pointed difficult questions that you dread to even imagine will be the exact same ones showing up on your reviewers' comments, in only slightly more polite language. So why not anticipate these questions and write in your rebuttals pre-emptively. Acknowledging a study's weaknesses and preparing to tackle them in future work is the hallmark of a diligent researcher. You can present this image by writing balanced evaluations of your methods and findings, with detailed proposals of improvements to your future work.

How to Write an Essay in 28 Tweaks

 
1. Have a point: have a thesis, not just a survey or information. There must be one point.
2. Get to the point: the reader should know what your paper is about by the third line of your introduction.
3. Analyze throughout: think of this paper as your contribution to the field. The majority of words should be your insight on the topic, not a summary of others’ work.
4. Be concrete: using “may”, “can” or “might” distracts the reader. You have done your research, now stand behind it.
5. Appropriate methodology: think about the topic, then decide which tools are best for researching it. The internet is convenient, but is not the best source for every topic.
6. Cite it!: as well as guarding you from academic misconduct, citations add credibility to your paper.
7. Limit your scope: in the introduction, tell your reader the limits of your research. This step shows the reader why your paper has certain omissions. For example “My research is limited to English language materials from Canadian authors.”
8. Adopt a measured tone: aggressive writing doesn’t support your thesis, facts do. Both supporting and opposing arguments should be written with the same tone. Write clearly and avoid emotional language.
9. Open with a bang: use the introduction to excite the reader and bring them in. Remember, your professor has a lot of reading to do. The right introduction will help keep his or her attention.
10. Provide a map: in the introduction, show your reader an overview of your paper. For example: “In Part I: Impact of Facebook on Student Health, I find a positive correlation between time spent social networking and weight gain. In Part II:…”
11. Titles: use descriptive titles to break up sections. This helps the reader understand the flow of your paper.
12. Avoid echos: George Orwell says “never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.” An echo will distract your reader, while unique figurative language will help them understand your content.
13. Short and sweet: this one is Orwell too. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
14. Use long words: if a longer word is more precise than a short one, use it. Did you know that the longest word in English is “Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis”?
15. Snip-snip: Cut out every unnecessary word.
16. Active over Passive: this is a pet-peeve of many professors. Always use the active voice in your writing. The active voice structure is subject/verb/object. For example: “Ben (subject) passed (verb) the ball (object).” Not, “The ball was passed by Ben”. Often “was” means you are using passive voice. Change your spelling and grammar editor to highlight these points.
17. Ctrl+f search for “that”: most of them will be unnecessary. Delete.
18. Plain English: replace all foreign phrases, scientific or jargon words with an everyday English equivalent.
19. Use www.paperrater.com: this site checks spelling and grammar, warns against plagiarism and provides a statistical analysis of your word usage.
20. Use lists: they are concise, break up paragraphs and look nice on the page.
21. Length: aim for paragraphs that are 4-6 sentences each.
22. Avoid wordiness: according to Professor Strunk, “a sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.”
23. Check punctuation: especially periods and commas. These regulate the flow of your sentences, and misuse can disrupt your reader even when you have selected the right words.
24. Cut big, then small: eliminate unnecessary paragraphs, then sentences, then words.
25. Simple over technical: use shorter words, sentences and paragraphs to explain complex points.
26. Do research in advance: even if you don’t start writing the paper, overtime you will develop arguments and structure.
27. The post-outline: you may start your paper by writing an outline, write one at the end too. The outline should show a logical flow of ideas and highlight any weaknesses.
28. Follow the rules for numbers: write numbers under 10 as words, and those above 10 as figures. ie. five, eight, 11, 15.

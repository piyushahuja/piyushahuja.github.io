Refuse to use the word “thing.”

Each thing can be described in more detail. When we don’t we’re just being lazy. Don’t drown the cake in frosting to avoid baking a new one.

Let a device be a device, a trait be a trait, a feeling be a feeling.

Before: “This is the greatest thing my parents taught me.”

After: “This is the greatest lesson my parents taught me.”
